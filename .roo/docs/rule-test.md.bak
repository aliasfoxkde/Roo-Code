# Rule Testing Guidelines

## Purpose
This document provides guidelines for testing and validating rules within the Kilo-Code system to ensure they function correctly and provide the intended benefits.

## General Testing Principles

### Rule Validation
- Every rule must have a clear, testable objective
- Rules should be validated against real-world scenarios
- Test cases should cover both positive and negative examples
- Edge cases must be explicitly considered and tested

### Implementation Testing
- Test rule application in various contexts
- Verify rule interactions with other system components
- Ensure rules work across different project types
- Validate rule behavior with different input formats

## Testing Process

### 1. Rule Definition Testing
1. Verify rule metadata is complete and accurate
2. Confirm rule structure follows established conventions
3. Test rule parsing and validation
4. Validate rule dependencies and prerequisites

### 2. Integration Testing
1. Test rule application within the Kilo-Code workflow
2. Verify rule interactions with other rules
3. Check rule behavior in different execution modes
4. Validate rule performance and resource usage

### 3. User Experience Testing
1. Ensure rule explanations are clear and actionable
2. Test rule feedback mechanisms
3. Verify rule documentation is accessible
4. Confirm rule customization options work as expected

## Quality Assurance Guidelines

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Each rule must have at least one positive test case
- Negative test cases should cover common misuse scenarios
- Edge cases should be explicitly tested
- Cross-rule interaction scenarios should be validated

### Validation Standards
- Rules must pass all defined test cases before deployment
- Test results should be documented and versioned
- Rule changes require corresponding test updates
- Test failures should block rule deployment
