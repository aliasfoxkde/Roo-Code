      <title>Hypothesize Root Causes</title>
      <description>
        Generate multiple potential explanations for the problem based on available information.
      </description>
      <approach>
        <approach>Consider 5-7 different possible sources</approach>
        <approach>Think about both obvious and subtle causes</approach>
        <approach>Consider environmental and configuration factors</approach>

      <title>Validate Hypotheses Systematically</title>
      <description>
        Test each hypothesis methodically to narrow down the actual cause.
