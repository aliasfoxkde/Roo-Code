# Security Standards and Best Practices

## Overview
Comprehensive security standards and best practices for KiloCode projects to ensure the protection of data, systems, and users throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Implement multiple layers of security controls
- Assume breaches will occur and plan accordingly
- Use redundant security mechanisms
- Validate at multiple points in the system

### 2. Least Privilege
- Grant minimum necessary permissions
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary access
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Implement just-in-time access where possible

### 3. Secure by Default
- Enable security features by default
- Use secure configurations out of the box
- Fail securely when errors occur
- Validate all inputs and outputs

### 4. Privacy by Design
- Implement privacy controls from the start
- Minimize data collection and retention
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Provide user control over personal data

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Standards
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for all administrative and sensitive accounts
- **Password Security**: Enforce strong password policies and use secure password storage
- **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling with proper timeouts
- **Token Management**: Use short-lived tokens with proper refresh mechanisms

### Authorization Standards
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement granular role-based permissions
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Use attributes for dynamic access decisions
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify every request regardless of source
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions

## Data Protection

### Data Classification
- **Public**: Information that can be freely shared
- **Internal**: Information for internal use only
- **Confidential**: Sensitive business information
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive personal or business data

### Encryption Standards
- **At Rest**: Use AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **In Transit**: Use TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Implement proper key rotation and storage
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Where appropriate, implement E2E encryption

### Data Handling
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and API requests
- **Output Encoding**: Encode data for proper context (HTML, SQL, etc.)
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Secure Disposal**: Properly destroy data when no longer needed
