## Related Resources
- Links to related documentation
- External references and sources

## Changelog
- Version history and updates
```

### README Standards
**Required Sections**:
1. Project Title and Description
2. Table of Contents
3. Installation Instructions
4. Usage Examples

6. Contributing Guidelines
7. License Information
8. Support and Contact

**Best Practices**:
- Keep README files concise but comprehensive
- Use badges for build status, coverage, and version info
- Include quick start examples
- Provide clear contribution guidelines

## Writing Standards

### Language and Style
- Use active voice and present tense
- Write in plain English, avoiding jargon
- Be concise and specific
- Use consistent terminology throughout

### Formatting Guidelines
- Use markdown for all documentation
- Follow semantic heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- Use code blocks for technical examples
- Include alt text for all images
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity

### Code Examples
- Provide working code examples
- Include expected output where relevant
- Use consistent syntax highlighting
- Document example prerequisites and setup

## Visual Documentation

### Diagrams and Charts

- Include clear labels and legends
- Provide textual descriptions for accessibility
- Maintain vector formats for scalability

### Screenshots
- Use high-resolution images
- Include contextual information
- Maintain consistent styling and branding
- Provide alternative text descriptions

## Version Control and Maintenance

### Documentation as Code
- Store documentation in version control alongside code
- Treat documentation changes with same review process as code
- Use automated testing for documentation builds
- Maintain documentation branches aligned with code branches

### Update Policies
- Update documentation with every code change
- Review and refresh documentation quarterly
- Archive deprecated documentation
- Track documentation coverage metrics

### Localization
- Plan for multilingual support from the start
- Use translation-friendly writing styles
- Maintain glossaries of technical terms
- Coordinate translation updates with releases

## Quality Assurance

### Review Process
- Technical accuracy review by subject matter experts
- Language and clarity review by technical writers
- Peer review by other developers
- User acceptance testing for user-facing docs

### Testing Documentation
- Verify all code examples and commands
- Test installation and setup instructions
- Validate links and external references
- Check accessibility and usability

## Tools and Automation

### Documentation Generation
- Use automated tools for API documentation
- Generate reference documentation from code comments
- Maintain consistent templates and styles
- Integrate documentation builds with CI/CD

### Publishing and Distribution
- Host documentation on accessible platforms
- Provide multiple formats (HTML, PDF, ePub)
- Enable search and navigation features
- Monitor documentation usage and feedback

## Accessibility Standards

### Inclusive Design
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Provide alternative text for images
- Use sufficient color contrast
- Support screen readers and assistive technologies

### Multilingual Support
- Plan for internationalization from the start
- Use translation management tools
- Maintain consistent terminology across languages
- Coordinate translation quality assurance

## Collaboration and Workflow

### Team Documentation
- Maintain team knowledge bases
- Document decisions and rationale
- Share best practices and lessons learned
- Keep meeting notes and action items

### Community Contributions
- Accept documentation contributions from users
- Provide clear contribution guidelines
- Review and integrate community feedback
- Credit community contributors appropriately

## Metrics and Improvement

### Documentation Quality Metrics
