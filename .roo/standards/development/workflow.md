# Development Workflow Standards

## Overview
Standardized development workflows for consistent, high-quality software development across all KiloCode projects.

## Core Principles

### 1. Plan-First Approach
- Always create a detailed plan before implementation
- Break complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- Validate requirements and constraints upfront
- Document architecture and design decisions

### 2. Iterative Development
- Work in small, focused iterations
- Test frequently during development
- Gather feedback early and often
- Refactor continuously for improvement

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow established coding standards
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Document complex logic and decisions

## Development Phases

### 1. Requirements Analysis
**Objective**: Understand and document what needs to be built

**Activities**:
- Gather and analyze requirements
- Identify constraints and dependencies
- Define success criteria and acceptance tests
- Create detailed specifications

**Deliverables**:
- Requirements document
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications

### 2. Design and Architecture
**Objective**: Plan the technical approach and system structure

**Activities**:
- Design system architecture
- Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks
- Plan data structures and interfaces
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies

**Deliverables**:
- Architecture diagrams
- Technical design document
- Implementation plan

### 3. Implementation
**Objective**: Build the solution according to specifications

**Activities**:
- Write clean, well-documented code
- Follow coding standards and best practices
- Implement error handling and logging
- Write unit and integration tests

**Deliverables**:
- Working code implementation
- Unit tests
- Integration tests

### 4. Testing and Validation
**Objective**: Ensure quality and correctness

**Activities**:
- Execute unit tests
- Perform integration testing
- Conduct manual testing where needed
- Validate against requirements and acceptance criteria

**Deliverables**:
- Test results and reports
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Performance benchmarks

### 5. Documentation
**Objective**: Create comprehensive documentation

**Activities**:
- Update technical documentation
- Create user guides and examples
- Document APIs and interfaces
- Maintain changelogs and release notes

**Deliverables**:
- Updated documentation
- User guides
- API documentation

### 6. Review and Deployment
**Objective**: Final validation and release

**Activities**:
- Code review and peer feedback
- Security and performance review
- Deployment preparation
- Release coordination

**Deliverables**:
- Reviewed and approved code
- Deployment artifacts
- Release notes

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Keep functions and methods small and focused
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns
- Include comprehensive comments for complex logic

### Version Control
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format
- Create feature branches for significant changes
- Regularly sync with main branch

### Collaboration
- Communicate progress and blockers promptly
- Seek feedback on design decisions
- Document decisions and rationale
- Share knowledge and best practices

## Tools and Automation

### Development Tools
- Use integrated development environments
- Leverage code analysis and linting tools
- Utilize debugging and profiling tools
- Automate repetitive tasks where possible

### Testing Automation
- Implement continuous integration pipelines
- Automate unit and integration tests
- Use code coverage analysis
- Integrate security scanning

### Documentation Automation
- Generate API documentation from code
- Maintain automated documentation builds
- Use consistent formatting and templates
- Keep documentation versioned with code

## Quality Gates

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows established standards
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive and passing
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Security considerations are addressed
- [ ] Performance implications are evaluated

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] Code is properly reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Release notes are prepared
- [ ] Rollback plan is available

## Continuous Improvement

### Retrospectives
- Conduct regular team retrospectives
- Identify process improvements
- Document lessons learned
- Implement actionable improvements

### Metrics and Monitoring
- Track development velocity and quality metrics
- Monitor system performance and reliability
- Measure user satisfaction and adoption
- Use data to drive process improvements

## Conclusion
These development workflow standards provide a framework for consistent, high-quality software development. Regular review and updates ensure they remain relevant and effective as the team and technology evolve.
