# Context Optimization Principles

## Overview
Fundamental principles and guidelines for optimizing context management in AI-assisted development to maximize efficiency, accuracy, and relevance while minimizing cognitive load and processing overhead.

## Core Context Optimization Principles

### 1. Relevance Filtering
**Principle**: Include only information directly relevant to the current task or query

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Prioritize recent and task-specific information
- Filter out historical context that doesn't impact current work
- Use semantic analysis to identify relevant content
- Implement progressive disclosure of context layers

**Best Practices**:
- Regular context relevance audits
- Dynamic context pruning based on task focus
- User-controlled context depth settings
- Context similarity scoring algorithms

### 2. Hierarchical Organization
**Principle**: Structure context in logical layers from most to least important

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Primary context: Immediate task and files
- Secondary context: Related project components
- Tertiary context: Broader project and system knowledge
- Background context: General domain knowledge

**Best Practices**:
- Clear context layer boundaries
- Easy navigation between context levels
- Layer-specific relevance weighting
- Context inheritance and override mechanisms

### 3. Temporal Awareness
**Principle**: Weight context based on recency and temporal relevance

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Recent interactions have higher priority
- Task completion resets context priorities
- Time-based context decay algorithms
- Session-aware context management

**Best Practices**:
- Context freshness scoring
- Automatic context refresh triggers
- Historical context archiving
- Temporal context correlation analysis

### 4. Cognitive Load Management
