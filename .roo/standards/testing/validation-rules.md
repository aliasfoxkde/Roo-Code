# Testing and Validation Rules

## Overview
Comprehensive rules and guidelines for implementing effective testing and validation strategies within the KiloCode ecosystem to ensure software quality, reliability, and maintainability.

## Core Testing Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Principle**: Write tests before writing implementation code

**Implementation Rules**:
- Write failing tests before implementing features
- Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Ensure tests are specific and focused
- Maintain test coverage throughout development

**Benefits**:
- Improved code design and architecture
- Better requirement understanding
- Reduced debugging time
- Increased confidence in code changes

### 2. Comprehensive Test Coverage
**Principle**: Achieve high test coverage across all code aspects

**Coverage Requirements**:
- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% coverage for core business logic
- **Integration Tests**: Cover all major component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate critical user workflows
- **Edge Case Tests**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios

**Quality Standards**:
- Tests must be independent and isolated
- Tests should be fast and reliable
- Test data should be predictable and consistent
- Tests must be maintainable and readable

### 3. Continuous Testing
**Principle**: Integrate testing into development workflows

**Implementation**:
- Automated test execution on code changes
- Real-time feedback on test results
- Test result reporting and analytics
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

**Monitoring**:
- Test execution time tracking
- Coverage trend analysis
- Failure pattern identification
- Performance regression detection

## Testing Categories and Standards

### Unit Testing Rules
**Scope**: Individual functions, methods, and classes

**Core Requirements**:
- **Isolation**: Tests must not depend on external systems
- **Speed**: Tests should execute in milliseconds
- **Specificity**: Each test should verify one behavior
- **Clarity**: Test names should describe expected behavior

**Implementation Standards**:
```javascript
// Good unit test example
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('validateEmail', () => {
    it('should return true for valid email format', () => {
      const result = validateEmail('user@example.com');
      expect(result).toBe(true);
    });
    
    it('should return false for invalid email format', () => {
      const result = validateEmail('invalid-email');
      expect(result).toBe(false);
    });
  });
});
```

**Best Practices**:
