**User:**

<task>
You are a VS Code Extension (AI wrapper) that has agentic features to assist or automate development called KiloCode, based on a merge of Cline and Roo Code (which is a fork of Cline with more features).

Rules, "knowledge" and structure allow you to operate better doing useful things and this all happens out of the .kilocode directory (which can be global or per project). I copied my global version to ./.kilocode for you to review and improve.

Please audit the code base and look at the .kilocode folder (as well as the original that I renamed to .kilocode.old, which came with the base fork). Understand everything about the code base and do a deep audit, using deep research (web), tools (mcp, etc.), chain of thought reasoning with abductive and deductive logic to work through it systematically.

I would like you to align the Rules/Settings to work optimally with this system so that it can improve the out of the box experience and make AI truly helpful to development. This is the work of a combination of my own development notes, how I plan as well as my methodology, etc. and also has been gleaned from prompts found in the new Amazon Kiro spec IDE editor, cline, roo code, and KiloCode (this one).

Context is huge for AI system and I want to refine all data here in such a way that the system retains "lessons learned" throughout development, improves the prompts/rules/etc. and has the best chance OOTB (out of the box) to be successful.

The goal is to eventually have a system that runs autonomously with at most a detailed plan hashed out with the user. I imagine to to eventually be a project request form manager that the user submits their idea, either lets the AI build the plan and then reviews it or they go back and forth with the user until all parts of the plan are finalized; the planning should be complete and detailed including methodology, architecture, constraints, etc. to first create ./docs/PLAN.md in the project folder, then once "approved" the AI uses that plan to create a PRD, and all project docs. Then the AI uses more deep research, planning and whatnot to work through the problem step-by-step, validating along the way.

The idea is to have runners run agentically but have a simple front end to manage several systems (VS Code instances at first) from a simple PWA web app for mobile that can be accessed anywhere and full manage the system (my first version will be 8 VS Code instances running on a Raspberry Pi 5 16GB. Effectively using API's to turn this SBC into a Supercomputer powerhouse running on under 10 watts.

That's my use case, however this build system should work for any code or project (from writing a book, doing deep research, analysis, to various code projects categorized by type (web, desktop, etc.) and grouped by tech stack (using clean templates that start with clean code, docs, and has no errors/warnings) and full test coverage, built on top of frameworks, libraries, etc. so that other people maintain them and our development can focus on the purpose we want.

With all that said, your purpose --and the first part of all this plan-- is to improve the rules, prompts, and prompt system (along with templates and knowledge used to make the system more efficient). 

Soon I would like to bundle up all these prompts and underlying system into a custom fork of KiloCode that I can add additional features to (I have an extensive list) and the .kilocode gets rolled up into the VS Code Extension and extracted to the users directory (global defaults) and works right OOTB.

The I cloned the code and put it in my GitHub, naming it Hivemind (the working title of the customized extension, work in progress).

Please look at the code, the .kilocode folder and use all resources available (deep research, tools, system, etc.) to improve the rules and make them aligned with the system so that they are automatically used by the system.

Create an extensive and comprehensive plan, followed by a task list and work through that list one-by-one until complete.

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

I need to understand the task and the codebase structure. The user wants me to audit the .kilocode folder and improve the rules, prompts, and prompt system. Let me first explore the .kilocode directory to understand its structure and contents.

I can see from the environment details that there's a .kilocode directory in the current workspace (c:/Repos/Hivemind). I should also check if there's a .kilocode.old directory as mentioned in the task. Let me list the files in the current directory to see what's there.

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule</custom_instructions>

<content lines="1-321">
  1 | import { McpHub } from "../../../services/mcp/McpHub"
  2 | import { DiffStrategy } from "../../../shared/tools"
  3 | 
  4 | export async function createMCPServerInstructions(
  5 | 	mcpHub: McpHub | undefined,
  6 | 	diffStrategy: DiffStrategy | undefined,
  7 | ): Promise<string> {
  8 | 	if (!diffStrategy || !mcpHub) throw new Error("Missing MCP Hub or Diff Strategy")
  9 | 
 10 | 	return `You have the ability to create an MCP server and add it to a configuration file that will then expose the tools and resources for you to use with \`use_mcp_tool\` and \`access_mcp_resource\`.
 11 | 
 12 | When creating MCP servers, it's important to understand that they operate in a non-interactive environment. The server cannot initiate OAuth flows, open browser windows, or prompt for user input during runtime. All credentials and authentication tokens must be provided upfront through environment variables in the MCP settings configuration. For example, Spotify's API uses OAuth to get a refresh token for the user, but the MCP server cannot initiate this flow. While you can walk the user through obtaining an application client ID and secret, you may have to create a separate one-time setup script (like get-refresh-token.js) that captures and logs the final piece of the puzzle: the user's refresh token (i.e. you might run the script using execute_command which would open a browser for authentication, and then log the refresh token so that you can see it in the command output for you to use in the MCP settings configuration).
 13 | 
 14 | Unless the user specifies otherwise, new local MCP servers should be created in: ${await mcpHub.getMcpServersPath()}
 15 | 
 16 | ### MCP Server Types and Configuration
 17 | 
 18 | MCP servers can be configured in two ways in the MCP settings file:
 19 | 
 20 | 1. Local (Stdio) Server Configuration:
 21 | \`\`\`json
 22 | {
 23 | 	"mcpServers": {
 24 | 		"local-weather": {
 25 | 			"command": "node",
 26 | 			"args": ["/path/to/weather-server/build/index.js"],
 27 | 			"env": {
 28 | 				"OPENWEATHER_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
 29 | 			}
 30 | 		}
 31 | 	}
 32 | }
 33 | \`\`\`
 34 | 
 35 | 2. Remote (SSE) Server Configuration:
 36 | \`\`\`json
 37 | {
 38 | 	"mcpServers": {
 39 | 		"remote-weather": {
 40 | 			"url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
 41 | 			"headers": {
 42 | 				"Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key"
 43 | 			}
 44 | 		}
 45 | 	}
 46 | }
 47 | \`\`\`
 48 | 
 49 | Common configuration options for both types:
 50 | - \`disabled\`: (optional) Set to true to temporarily disable the server
 51 | - \`timeout\`: (optional) Maximum time in seconds to wait for server responses (default: 60)
 52 | - \`alwaysAllow\`: (optional) Array of tool names that don't require user confirmation
 53 | - \`disabledTools\`: (optional) Array of tool names that are not included in the system prompt and won't be used
 54 | 
 55 | ### Example Local MCP Server
 56 | 
 57 | For example, if the user wanted to give you the ability to retrieve weather information, you could create an MCP server that uses the OpenWeather API to get weather information, add it to the MCP settings configuration file, and then notice that you now have access to new tools and resources in the system prompt that you might use to show the user your new capabilities.
 58 | 
 59 | The following example demonstrates how to build a local MCP server that provides weather data functionality using the Stdio transport. While this example shows how to implement resources, resource templates, and tools, in practice you should prefer using tools since they are more flexible and can handle dynamic parameters. The resource and resource template implementations are included here mainly for demonstration purposes of the different MCP capabilities, but a real weather server would likely just expose tools for fetching weather data. (The following steps are for macOS)
 60 | 
 61 | 1. Use the \`create-typescript-server\` tool to bootstrap a new project in the default MCP servers directory:
 62 | 
 63 | \`\`\`bash
 64 | cd ${await mcpHub.getMcpServersPath()}
 65 | npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server weather-server
 66 | cd weather-server
 67 | # Install dependencies
 68 | npm install axios zod @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
 69 | \`\`\`
 70 | 
 71 | This will create a new project with the following structure:
 72 | 
 73 | \`\`\`
 74 | weather-server/
 75 | 	├── package.json
 76 | 			{

263 | const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
264 | await server.connect(transport);
265 | console.error('Weather MCP server running on stdio');
266 | \`\`\`
267 | 
268 | (Remember: This is just an example–you may use different dependencies, break the implementation up into multiple files, etc.)
269 | 
270 | 3. Build and compile the executable JavaScript file
271 | 
272 | \`\`\`bash
273 | npm run build
274 | \`\`\`
275 | 
276 | 4. Whenever you need an environment variable such as an API key to configure the MCP server, walk the user through the process of getting the key. For example, they may need to create an account and go to a developer dashboard to generate the key. Provide step-by-step instructions and URLs to make it easy for the user to retrieve the necessary information. Then use the ask_followup_question tool to ask the user for the key, in this case the OpenWeather API key.
277 | 
278 | 5. Install the MCP Server by adding the MCP server configuration to the settings file located at '${await mcpHub.getMcpSettingsFilePath()}'. The settings file may have other MCP servers already configured, so you would read it first and then add your new server to the existing \`mcpServers\` object.
279 | 
280 | IMPORTANT: Regardless of what else you see in the MCP settings file, you must default any new MCP servers you create to disabled=false, alwaysAllow=[] and disabledTools=[].
281 | 
282 | \`\`\`json
283 | {
284 | 	"mcpServers": {
285 | 		...,
286 | 		"weather": {
287 | 			"command": "node",
288 | 			"args": ["/path/to/weather-server/build/index.js"],
289 | 			"env": {
290 | 				"OPENWEATHER_API_KEY": "user-provided-api-key"
291 | 			}
292 | 		},
293 | 	}
294 | }
295 | \`\`\`
296 | 
297 | (Note: the user may also ask you to install the MCP server to the Claude desktop app, in which case you would read then modify \`~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\` on macOS for example. It follows the same format of a top level \`mcpServers\` object.)
298 | 
299 | 6. After you have edited the MCP settings configuration file, the system will automatically run all the servers and expose the available tools and resources in the 'Connected MCP Servers' section.
300 | 
301 | 7. Now that you have access to these new tools and resources, you may suggest ways the user can command you to invoke them - for example, with this new weather tool now available, you can invite the user to ask "what's the weather in San Francisco?"
302 | 
303 | ## Editing MCP Servers
304 | 
305 | The user may ask to add tools or resources that may make sense to add to an existing MCP server (listed under 'Connected MCP Servers' above: ${(() => {
306 | 		if (!mcpHub) return "(None running currently)"
307 | 		const servers = mcpHub
308 | 			.getServers()
309 | 			.map((server) => server.name)
310 | 			.join(", ")
311 | 		return servers || "(None running currently)"
312 | 	})()}, e.g. if it would use the same API. This would be possible if you can locate the MCP server repository on the user's system by looking at the server arguments for a filepath. You might then use list_files and read_file to explore the files in the repository, and use write_to_file${diffStrategy ? " or apply_diff" : ""} to make changes to the files.
313 | 
314 | However some MCP servers may be running from installed packages rather than a local repository, in which case it may make more sense to create a new MCP server.
315 | 
316 | # MCP Servers Are Not Always Necessary
317 | 
318 | The user may not always request the use or creation of MCP servers. Instead, they might provide tasks that can be completed with existing tools. While using the MCP SDK to extend your capabilities can be useful, it's important to understand that this is just one specialized type of task you can accomplish. You should only implement MCP servers when the user explicitly requests it (e.g., "add a tool that...").
319 | 
320 | Remember: The MCP documentation and example provided above are to help you understand and work with existing MCP servers or create new ones when requested by the user. You already have access to tools and capabilities that can be used to accomplish a wide range of tasks.`

12 | Custom modes can be configured in two ways:
13 |   1. Globally via '${customModesPath}' (created automatically on startup)
14 |   2. Per-workspace via '.kilocodemodes' in the workspace root directory
15 | 
16 | When modes with the same slug exist in both files, the workspace-specific .kilocodemodes version takes precedence. This allows projects to override global modes or define project-specific modes.
17 | 
18 | 
19 | If asked to create a project mode, create it in .kilocodemodes in the workspace root. If asked to create a global mode, use the global custom modes file.
20 |

22 |   * slug: A valid slug (lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens). Must be unique, and shorter is better.
23 |   * name: The display name for the mode
24 |   * roleDefinition: A detailed description of the mode's role and capabilities
25 |   * groups: Array of allowed tool groups (can be empty). Each group can be specified either as a string (e.g., "edit" to allow editing any file) or with file restrictions (e.g., ["edit", { fileRegex: "\\.md$", description: "Markdown files only" }] to only allow editing markdown files)
26 | 
27 | - The following fields are optional but highly recommended:
28 |   * description: A short, human-readable description of what this mode does (5 words)
29 |   * whenToUse: A clear description of when this mode should be selected and what types of tasks it's best suited for. This helps the Orchestrator mode make better decisions.
30 |   * customInstructions: Additional instructions for how the mode should operate

 66 | RULES
 67 | 
 68 | - The project base directory is: ${cwd.toPosix()}
 69 | - All file paths must be relative to this directory. However, commands may change directories in terminals, so respect working directory specified by the response to <execute_command>.
 70 | - You cannot \`cd\` into a different directory to complete a task. You are stuck operating from '${cwd.toPosix()}', so be sure to pass in the correct 'path' parameter when using tools that require a path.
 71 | - Do not use the ~ character or $HOME to refer to the home directory.
 72 | - Before using the execute_command tool, you must first think about the SYSTEM INFORMATION context provided to understand the user's environment and tailor your commands to ensure they are compatible with their system. You must also consider if the command you need to run should be executed in a specific directory outside of the current working directory '${cwd.toPosix()}', and if so prepend with \`cd\`'ing into that directory && then executing the command (as one command since you are stuck operating from '${cwd.toPosix()}'). For example, if you needed to run \`npm install\` in a project outside of '${cwd.toPosix()}', you would need to prepend with a \`cd\` i.e. pseudocode for this would be \`cd (path to project) && (command, in this case npm install)\`.
 73 | ${codebaseSearchRule}- When using the search_files tool${isCodebaseSearchAvailable ? " (after codebase_search)" : ""}, craft your regex patterns carefully to balance specificity and flexibility. Based on the user's task you may use it to find code patterns, TODO comments, function definitions, or any text-based information across the project. The results include context, so analyze the surrounding code to better understand the matches. Leverage the search_files tool in combination with other tools for more comprehensive analysis. For example, use it to find specific code patterns, then use read_file to examine the full context of interesting matches before using ${diffStrategy ? "apply_diff or write_to_file" : "write_to_file"} to make informed changes.
 74 | - When creating a new project (such as an app, website, or any software project), organize all new files within a dedicated project directory unless the user specifies otherwise. Use appropriate file paths when writing files, as the write_to_file tool will automatically create any necessary directories. Structure the project logically, adhering to best practices for the specific type of project being created. Unless otherwise specified, new projects should be easily run without additional setup, for example most projects can be built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - which you can open in a browser.
 75 | ${getEditingInstructions(diffStrategy)}
 76 | - Some modes have restrictions on which files they can edit. If you attempt to edit a restricted file, the operation will be rejected with a FileRestrictionError that will specify which file patterns are allowed for the current mode.
 77 | - Be sure to consider the type of project (e.g. Python, JavaScript, web application) when determining the appropriate structure and files to include. Also consider what files may be most relevant to accomplishing the task, for example looking at a project's manifest file would help you understand the project's dependencies, which you could incorporate into any code you write.
 78 |   * For example, in architect mode trying to edit app.js would be rejected because architect mode can only edit files matching "\\.md$"
 79 | - When making changes to code, always consider the context in which the code is being used. Ensure that your changes are compatible with the existing codebase and that they follow the project's coding standards and best practices.
 80 | - Do not ask for more information than necessary. Use the tools provided to accomplish the user's request efficiently and effectively. When you've completed your task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result to the user. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again.
 81 | - You are only allowed to ask the user questions using the ask_followup_question tool. Use this tool only when you need additional details to complete a task, and be sure to use a clear and concise question that will help you move forward with the task. When you ask a question, provide the user with 2-4 suggested answers based on your question so they don't need to do so much typing. The suggestions should be specific, actionable, and directly related to the completed task. They should be ordered by priority or logical sequence. However if you can use the available tools to avoid having to ask the user questions, you should do so. For example, if the user mentions a file that may be in an outside directory like the Desktop, you should use the list_files tool to list the files in the Desktop and check if the file they are talking about is there, rather than asking the user to provide the file path themselves.
 82 | - When executing commands, if you don't see the expected output, assume the terminal executed the command successfully and proceed with the task. The user's terminal may be unable to stream the output back properly. If you absolutely need to see the actual terminal output, use the ask_followup_question tool to request the user to copy and paste it back to you.
 83 | - The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.
 84 | - Your goal is to try to accomplish the user's task, NOT engage in a back and forth conversation.${
 85 | 		supportsComputerUse
 86 | 			? '\n- The user may ask generic non-development tasks, such as "what\'s the latest news" or "look up the weather in San Diego", in which case you might use the browser_action tool to complete the task if it makes sense to do so, rather than trying to create a website or using curl to answer the question. However, if an available MCP server tool or resource can be used instead, you should prefer to use it over browser_action.'
 87 | 			: ""
 88 | 	}
 89 | - NEVER end attempt_completion result with a question or request to engage in further conversation! Formulate the end of your result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user.
 90 | - You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from starting your messages with "Great", "Certainly", "Okay", "Sure". You should NOT be conversational in your responses, but rather direct and to the point. For example you should NOT say "Great, I've updated the CSS" but instead something like "I've updated the CSS". It is important you be clear and technical in your messages.
 91 | - When presented with images, utilize your vision capabilities to thoroughly examine them and extract meaningful information. Incorporate these insights into your thought process as you accomplish the user's task.
 92 | - At the end of each user message, you will automatically receive environment_details. This information is not written by the user themselves, but is auto-generated to provide potentially relevant context about the project structure and environment. While this information can be valuable for understanding the project context, do not treat it as a direct part of the user's request or response. Use it to inform your actions and decisions, but don't assume the user is explicitly asking about or referring to this information unless they clearly do so in their message. When using environment_details, explain your actions clearly to ensure the user understands, as they may not be aware of these details.
 93 | - Before executing commands, check the "Actively Running Terminals" section in environment_details. If present, consider how these active processes might impact your task. For example, if a local development server is already running, you wouldn't need to start it again. If no active terminals are listed, proceed with command execution as normal.
 94 | - MCP operations should be used one at a time, similar to other tool usage. Wait for confirmation of success before proceeding with additional operations.
 95 | - It is critical you wait for the user's response after each tool use, in order to confirm the success of the tool use. For example, if asked to make a todo app, you would create a file, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, then create another file if needed, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, etc.${
 96 | 		supportsComputerUse
 97 | 			? " Then if you want to test your work, you might use browser_action to launch the site, wait for the user's response confirming the site was launched along with a screenshot, then perhaps e.g., click a button to test functionality if needed, wait for the user's response confirming the button was clicked along with a screenshot of the new state, before finally closing the browser."

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule</custom_instructions>
You have not created a todo list yet. Create one with `update_todo_list` if your task is complicated or involves multiple steps.

**Assistant:**

Now let me check the shared/modes.ts file to understand the current modes structure:

<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>src/shared/modes.ts</path>
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

**User:**

[read_file for 'src/shared/modes.ts'. Reading multiple files at once is more efficient for the LLM. If other files are relevant to your current task, please read them simultaneously.] Result:

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule</custom_instructions>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:

You have not created a todo list yet. Create one with `update_todo_list` if your task is complicated or involves multiple steps.

**Assistant:**

Let me check the types package to understand the mode structure:

<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>packages/types/src/mode.ts</path>
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

**User:**

[read_file for 'packages/types/src/mode.ts'. Reading multiple files at once is more efficient for the LLM. If other files are relevant to your current task, please read them simultaneously.] Result:

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule</custom_instructions>

**Assistant:**

Now let me check the test file for safeWriteJson to understand how it's used:

<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>src/utils/__tests__/safeWriteJson.test.ts</path>
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:

 1 | # Kilo-Code Standards Organization
 2 | 
 3 | This directory contains the standards and rules that govern the Kilo-Code system's behavior and operations. The standards are organized to optimize for both human readability and vector storage efficiency.
 4 | 
 5 | ## Directory Structure
 6 | 
 7 | The standards are organized into topical directories:
 8 | 
 9 | - `standards/code-quality/` - Code quality rules and guidelines
10 | - `standards/testing/` - Testing standards and guidelines
11 | - `standards/development/` - Development workflow and practices
12 | - `standards/documentation/` - Documentation standards and guidelines
13 | - `standards/security/` - Security practices and guidelines
14 | 
15 | ## File Structure Standards
16 | 
17 | All standard files follow a consistent structure for optimal vector storage:
18 | 
19 | ### Metadata Header
20 | 
21 | ```yaml
22 | ---
23 | title: "Descriptive Title"
24 | category: "Broad Category"
25 | subcategory: "Specific Area"
26 | tags: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
27 | last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
28 | applicability: "Scope of application"
29 | confidence: "Confidence level"
30 | ---
31 | ```
32 | 
33 | ### Content Organization
34 | 
35 | 1. **Purpose/Overview** - Clear statement of what the standard covers
36 | 2. **Principles** - High-level guiding principles
37 | 3. **Implementation** - Specific implementation details
38 | 4. **Examples** - Concrete examples where applicable
39 | 5. **Related Standards** - Cross-references to related standards
40 | 
41 | ## Vector Storage Optimization
42 | 
43 | - Files are chunked by section for efficient retrieval
44 | - Metadata provides context without loading full content
45 | - Cross-references enable related standard discovery
46 | - Consistent structure enables pattern-based processing
47 | 
48 | ## Best Practices
49 | 
50 | - Keep standard files focused on single topics
51 | - Use clear, actionable language
52 | - Provide specific examples
53 | - Maintain cross-references to related standards
54 | - Regularly update last_updated dates

11 | # Code Quality Rules
12 | 
13 | ## 1. Test Coverage
14 | 
15 | ### Principles
16 | - All code changes must have comprehensive test coverage
17 | - Tests must pass before any code is submitted
18 | - Testing frameworks and configurations are standardized
19 | 
20 | ### Implementation
21 | - Before attempting completion, always make sure that any code changes have test coverage
22 | - Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes
23 | - The vitest framework is used for testing; the `describe`, `test`, `it`, etc functions are defined by default in `tsconfig.json` and therefore don't need to be imported
24 | - Tests must be run from the same directory as the `package.json` file that specifies `vitest` in `devDependencies`
25 | - Run tests with: `npx vitest run <relative-path-from-workspace-root>`
26 | - Do NOT run tests from project root - this causes "vitest: command not found" error
27 | - Tests must be run from inside the correct workspace:
28 |   - Backend tests: `cd src && npx vitest run path/to/test-file` (don't include `src/` in path)
29 |   - UI tests: `cd webview-ui && npx vitest run src/path/to/test-file`
30 | 
31 | ### Examples
32 | - For `src/tests/user.test.ts`, run `cd src && npx vitest run tests/user.test.ts` NOT `npx vitest run src/tests/user.test.ts`
33 | 
34 | ### Related Rules
35 | - See also: [Rule Testing Guidelines](../testing/guidelines.md)
36 | - See also: Development Workflow rules
37 | 
38 | ## 2. Lint Rules
39 | 
40 | ### Principles
41 | - All code must pass strict linting rules automatically enforced by the system
42 | - Linting provides consistent code quality and prevents common errors
43 | - No warnings are allowed - all lint issues must be resolved as errors
44 | 
45 | ### Implementation
46 | - Linting rules are automatically applied during code analysis and cannot be bypassed
47 | - Common linting configurations include:
48 |   - ESLint with @typescript-eslint/recommended and prettier configurations
49 |   - Strict TypeScript compiler options (noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, etc.)
50 |   - Accessibility linting for UI components
51 |   - Security linting rules for potential vulnerabilities
52 | 
53 | ### Related Rules
54 | - See also: Security Practices rules
55 | - See also: Accessibility Guidelines rules
56 | 
57 | ## 3. Styling Guidelines
58 | 
59 | ### Principles
60 | - Consistent styling improves code readability and maintainability
61 | - Use established frameworks and conventions
62 | 
63 | ### Implementation
64 | - Use Tailwind CSS classes instead of inline style objects for new markup
65 | - VSCode CSS variables must be added to webview-ui/src/index.css before using them in Tailwind classes
66 | - Example: `<div className="text-md text-vscode-descriptionForeground mb-2" />` instead of style objects
67 | 
68 | ### Related Rules

11 | # Rule Testing Guidelines
12 | 
13 | ## Purpose
14 | This document provides guidelines for testing and validating rules within the Kilo-Code system to ensure they function correctly and provide the intended benefits.
15 | 
16 | ## General Testing Principles
17 | 
18 | ### Rule Validation
19 | - Every rule must have a clear, testable objective
20 | - Rules should be validated against real-world scenarios
21 | - Test cases should cover both positive and negative examples
22 | - Edge cases must be explicitly considered and tested
23 | 
24 | ### Implementation Testing
25 | - Test rule application in various contexts
26 | - Verify rule interactions with other system components
27 | - Ensure rules work across different project types
28 | - Validate rule behavior with different input formats
29 | 
30 | ## Testing Process
31 | 
32 | ### 1. Rule Definition Testing
33 | 1. Verify rule metadata is complete and accurate
34 | 2. Confirm rule structure follows established conventions
35 | 3. Test rule parsing and validation
36 | 4. Validate rule dependencies and prerequisites
37 | 
38 | ### 2. Integration Testing
39 | 1. Test rule application within the Kilo-Code workflow
40 | 2. Verify rule interactions with other rules
41 | 3. Check rule behavior in different execution modes
42 | 4. Validate rule performance and resource usage
43 | 
44 | ### 3. User Experience Testing
45 | 1. Ensure rule explanations are clear and actionable
46 | 2. Test rule feedback mechanisms
47 | 3. Verify rule documentation is accessible
48 | 4. Confirm rule customization options work as expected
49 | 
50 | ## Quality Assurance Guidelines
51 | 
52 | ### Test Coverage Requirements
53 | - Each rule must have at least one positive test case
54 | - Negative test cases should cover common misuse scenarios
55 | - Edge cases should be explicitly tested
56 | - Cross-rule interaction scenarios should be validated
57 | 
58 | ### Validation Standards
59 | - Rules must pass all defined test cases before deployment
60 | - Test results should be documented and versioned
61 | - Rule changes require corresponding test updates
62 | - Test failures should block rule deployment

**Assistant:**

Now I have a good understanding of the current system. Let me create a comprehensive plan for improving the rules and prompt system. Based on my analysis, I can see that:

1. The .kilocode directory contains a well-structured knowledge base with planning documents, task management, and context optimization frameworks
2. There are standards defined for code quality and testing, but many directories are empty
3. There's a specific rule for safeWriteJson that's already enforced
4. The system is designed to work with vector storage and dynamic context management

Let me create a comprehensive plan and then start implementing improvements:

<update_todo_list>
<todos>
[x] Analyze the current .kilocode directory structure and content
[x] Review existing planning documents and system design
[x] Examine current rules and standards structure
[-] Create comprehensive plan for rules and prompt system improvements
[ ] Implement core rules structure with proper metadata
[ ] Create development workflow standards
[ ] Create documentation standards
[ ] Create security standards
[ ] Implement mode-specific rules
[ ] Create tool usage guidelines
[ ] Develop context optimization rules
[ ] Create project template rules
[ ] Implement testing and validation rules
[ ] Create maintenance and update procedures
</todos>
</update_todo_list>

# Development Workflow Standards

## Purpose
This document establishes standardized development workflow practices to ensure consistent, efficient, and collaborative software development across all Kilo-Code projects.

## General Workflow Principles

### Continuous Integration
- All code changes must be integrated frequently through pull requests
- Automated testing must pass before any code merge
- Code reviews are mandatory for all changes
- Branch protection rules must be enforced

### Version Control
- Use Git with semantic versioning
- Follow conventional commit messages
- Maintain clean, linear commit history
- Use feature branches for all development work

### Collaboration
- Code reviews must be conducted by peers
- Documentation updates required for all functional changes
- Knowledge sharing through code comments and README updates
- Regular team synchronization meetings

## Implementation Process

### 1. Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from main branch
2. Implement changes following established coding standards
3. Write comprehensive tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Run full test suite locally before submission

### 2. Code Review Process
1. Submit pull request with clear description of changes
2. Request review from appropriate team members
3. Address all review comments and suggestions
4. Ensure all automated checks pass
5. Obtain approval before merging

### 3. Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests required for all new code
2. Integration tests for API and service interactions
3. End-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. Performance tests for resource-intensive operations

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:

**Assistant:**

I see the issue. The filesystem tool can only access the .kilocode directory. Let me create the security directory first and then the file:

<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>filesystem</server_name>
<tool_name>create_directory</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "path": ".kilocode/standards/security"
}

# Security Practices

## Purpose
This document establishes security best practices and requirements to ensure the development of secure, robust, and trustworthy software systems.

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
- Implement multiple layers of security controls
- Validate input at every entry point
- Apply security measures at all system levels
- Assume breaches will occur and plan accordingly

### Least Privilege
- Grant minimal necessary permissions
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary access
- Use role-based access control
- Implement just-in-time access when possible

### Secure by Default
- Enable security features by default
- Use strong default configurations
- Fail securely when errors occur
- Protect sensitive data from the start

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Authentication and Authorization
1. **Authentication**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive systems
   - Use secure password storage with proper hashing
   - Implement account lockout mechanisms
   - Support secure session management

2. **Authorization**
   - Validate permissions for every request
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Use secure token management
   - Regularly audit access permissions

### 2. Data Protection
1. **Data at Rest**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Use strong encryption algorithms
   - Manage encryption keys securely
   - Implement proper key rotation

2. **Data in Transit**
   - Use TLS for all network communications
   - Validate certificates and implement certificate pinning
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit
   - Implement secure API communication

### 3. Input Validation
1. **Sanitization**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper escaping for output

2. **Injection Prevention**
   - Prevent SQL injection attacks
   - Protect against cross-site scripting (XSS)
   - Validate file uploads
   - Implement proper error handling

## Security Testing

### Vulnerability Assessment
- Regular automated security scanning
- Manual penetration testing
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Configuration security reviews

### Code Review Security
- Security-focused code reviews
- Static analysis for security issues
- Dynamic analysis during testing
- Security pattern verification

### Incident Response
- Security incident response plan
- Regular security training
- Vulnerability disclosure process
- Post-incident analysis and improvement

## Compliance and Standards

### Regulatory Requirements
- GDPR compliance for data protection
- HIPAA compliance for healthcare data
- PCI DSS for payment processing
- Industry-specific security standards

### Best Practices
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement secure coding practices
- Regular security updates and patches
- Security awareness training

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations

**Assistant:**

I can see that the task was interrupted while I was working on creating mode-specific rules. Let me reassess the current state and continue with the task.

Looking at the current state, I can see that I have successfully created:
1. Development workflow standards
2. Documentation standards  
3. Security practices

I was in the process of creating mode-specific rules. Let me check the current .kilocode directory structure to understand what mode-related directories exist:

<list_files>
<path>.kilocode</path>
<recursive>false</recursive>
</list_files>

**Assistant:**

Let me check the general rules file to understand the format:

<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>.kilocode/rules-translate/001-general-rules.md</path>
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

---

**User:**

[read_file for '.kilocode/rules-translate/001-general-rules.md'. Reading multiple files at once is more efficient for the LLM. If other files are relevant to your current task, please read them simultaneously.] Result:
<files>
<file><path>.kilocode/rules-translate/001-general-rules.md</path>
<content lines="1-106">
  1 | # 1. SUPPORTED LANGUAGES AND LOCATION
  2 | 
  3 | - Localize all strings into the following locale files: ca, de, en, es, fr, hi, id, it, ja, ko, nl, pl, pt-BR, ru, tr, vi, zh-CN, zh-TW
  4 | - The VSCode extension has two main areas that require localization:
  5 |     - Core Extension: src/i18n/locales/ (extension backend)
  6 |     - WebView UI: webview-ui/src/i18n/locales/ (user interface)
  7 | 
  8 | # 2. VOICE, STYLE AND TONE
  9 | 
 10 | - Always use informal speech (e.g., "du" instead of "Sie" in German) for all translations
 11 | - Maintain a direct and concise style that mirrors the tone of the original text
 12 | - Carefully account for colloquialisms and idiomatic expressions in both source and target languages
 13 | - Aim for culturally relevant and meaningful translations rather than literal translations
 14 | - Preserve the personality and voice of the original content
 15 | - Use natural-sounding language that feels native to speakers of the target language
 16 | - Don't translate the word "token" as it means something specific in English that all languages will understand
 17 | - Don't translate domain-specific words (especially technical terms like "Prompt") that are commonly used in English in the target language
 18 | 
 19 | # 3. CORE EXTENSION LOCALIZATION (src/)
 20 | 
 21 | - Located in src/i18n/locales/
 22 | - NOT ALL strings in core source need internationalization - only user-facing messages
 23 | - Internal error messages, debugging logs, and developer-facing messages should remain in English
 24 | - The t() function is used with namespaces like 'core:errors.missingToolParameter'
 25 | - Be careful when modifying interpolation variables; they must remain consistent across all translations
 26 | - Some strings in formatResponse.ts are intentionally not internationalized since they're internal
 27 | - When updating strings in core.json, maintain all existing interpolation variables
 28 | - Check string usages in the codebase before making changes to ensure you're not breaking functionality
 29 | 
 30 | # 4. WEBVIEW UI LOCALIZATION (webview-ui/src/)
 31 | 
 32 | - Located in webview-ui/src/i18n/locales/
 33 | - Uses standard React i18next patterns with the useTranslation hook
 34 | - All user interface strings should be internationalized
 35 | - Always use the Trans component with named components for text with embedded components
 36 | 
 37 | <Trans> example:
 38 | 
 39 | `"changeSettings": "You can always change this at the bottom of the <settingsLink>settings</settingsLink>",`
 40 | 
 41 | ```
 42 |   <Trans
 43 |     i18nKey="welcome:telemetry.changeSettings"
 44 |     components={{
 45 |       settingsLink: <VSCodeLink href="#" onClick={handleOpenSettings} />
 46 |     }}
 47 |   />
 48 | ```
 49 | 
 50 | # 5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
 51 | 
 52 | - Use namespaces to organize translations logically
 53 | - Handle pluralization using i18next's built-in capabilities
 54 | - Implement proper interpolation for variables using {{variable}} syntax
 55 | - Don't include defaultValue. The `en` translations are the fallback
 56 | - Always use apply_diff instead of write_to_file when editing existing translation files (much faster and more reliable)
 57 | - When using apply_diff, carefully identify the exact JSON structure to edit to avoid syntax errors
 58 | - Placeholders (like {{variable}}) must remain exactly identical to the English source to maintain code integration and prevent syntax errors
 59 | 
 60 | # 6. WORKFLOW AND APPROACH
 61 | 
 62 | - First add or modify English strings, then ask for confirmation before translating to all other languages
 63 | - Use this process for each localization task:
 64 |     1. Identify where the string appears in the UI/codebase
 65 |     2. Understand the context and purpose of the string
 66 |     3. Update English translation first
 67 |     4. Use the `<search_files>` tool to find JSON keys that are near new keys in English translations but do not yet exist in the other language files for `<apply_diff>` SEARCH context
 68 |     5. Create appropriate translations for all other supported languages utilizing the `search_files` result using `<apply_diff>` without reading every file.
 69 |     6. Do not output the translated text into the chat, just modify the files.
 70 |     7. Validate your changes with the missing translations script
 71 | - Flag or comment if an English source string is incomplete ("please see this...") to avoid truncated or unclear translations
 72 | - For UI elements, distinguish between:
 73 |     - Button labels: Use short imperative commands ("Save", "Cancel")
 74 |     - Tooltip text: Can be slightly more descriptive
 75 | - Preserve the original perspective: If text is a user command directed at the software, ensure the translation maintains this direction, avoiding language that makes it sound like an instruction from the system to the user
 76 | 
 77 | # 7. COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
 78 | 
 79 | - Switching between formal and informal addressing styles - always stay informal ("du" not "Sie")
 80 | - Translating or altering technical terms and brand names that should remain in English
 81 | - Modifying or removing placeholders like {{variable}} - these must remain identical
 82 | - Translating domain-specific terms that are commonly used in English in the target language
 83 | - Changing the meaning or nuance of instructions or error messages
 84 | - Forgetting to maintain consistent terminology throughout the translation
 85 | 
 86 | # 8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
 87 | 
 88 | - Maintain consistent terminology across all translations
 89 | - Respect the JSON structure of translation files
 90 | - Watch for placeholders and preserve them in translations
 91 | - Be mindful of text length in UI elements when translating to languages that might require more characters
 92 | - Use context-aware translations when the same string has different meanings
 93 | - Always validate your translation work by running the missing translations script:
 94 |     ```
 95 |     node scripts/find-missing-translations.js
 96 |     ```
 97 | - Address any missing translations identified by the script to ensure complete coverage across all locales
 98 | 
 99 | # 9. TRANSLATOR'S CHECKLIST
100 | 
101 | - ✓ Used informal tone consistently ("du" not "Sie")
102 | - ✓ Preserved all placeholders exactly as in the English source
103 | - ✓ Maintained consistent terminology with existing translations
104 | - ✓ Kept technical terms and brand names unchanged where appropriate
105 | - ✓ Preserved the original perspective (user→system vs system→user)
106 | - ✓ Adapted the text appropriately for UI context (buttons vs tooltips)

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:

**Assistant:**

Let me check the shared/modes file to understand how modes are managed:

<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>src/shared/modes.ts</path>
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

**User:**

[read_file for 'src/shared/modes.ts'. Reading multiple files at once is more efficient for the LLM. If other files are relevant to your current task, please read them simultaneously.] Result:

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule</custom_instructions>

**Assistant:**

Now let me check what built-in modes exist by looking at some snapshot files:

<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>src/core/prompts/__tests__/__snapshots__/system-prompt/consistent-system-prompt.snap</path>
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

---

**User:**

[read_file for 'src/core/prompts/__tests__/__snapshots__/system-prompt/consistent-system-prompt.snap'. Reading multiple files at once is more efficient for the LLM. If other files are relevant to your current task, please read them simultaneously.] Result:
<files>
<file><path>src/core/prompts/__tests__/__snapshots__/system-prompt/consistent-system-prompt.snap</path>
<content lines="1-574">
  1 | You are Kilo Code, an experienced technical leader who is inquisitive and an excellent planner. Your goal is to gather information and get context to create a detailed plan for accomplishing the user's task, which the user will review and approve before they switch into another mode to implement the solution.

  4 | 
  5 | MARKDOWN RULES
  6 | 
  7 | ALL responses MUST show ANY `language construct` OR filename reference as clickable, exactly as [`filename OR language.declaration()`](relative/file/path.ext:line); line is required for `syntax` and optional for filename links. This applies to ALL markdown responses and ALSO those in <attempt_completion>

 11 | TOOL USE
 12 | 
 13 | You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.
 14 | 
 15 | # Tool Use Formatting
 16 | 
 17 | Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name itself becomes the XML tag name. Each parameter is enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:
 18 | 
 19 | <actual_tool_name>
 20 | <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
 21 | <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
 22 | ...
 23 | </actual_tool_name>
 24 | 
 25 | For example, to use the new_task tool:
 26 | 
 27 | <new_task>
 28 | <mode>code</mode>
 29 | <message>Implement a new feature for the application.</message>
 30 | </new_task>
 31 | 
 32 | Always use the actual tool name as the XML tag name for proper parsing and execution.
 33 | 
 34 | # Tools
 35 | 
 36 | ## read_file
 37 | Description: Request to read the contents of one or more files. The tool outputs line-numbered content (e.g. "1 | const x = 1") for easy reference when creating diffs or discussing code. Supports text extraction from PDF and DOCX files, but may not handle other binary files properly.
 38 | 
 39 | **IMPORTANT: You can read a maximum of 5 files in a single request.** If you need to read more files, use multiple sequential read_file requests.
 40 | 
 41 | 
 42 | Parameters:
 43 | - args: Contains one or more file elements, where each file contains:
 44 |   - path: (required) File path (relative to workspace directory /test/path)
 45 |   
 46 | 
 47 | Usage:
 48 | <read_file>
 49 | <args>
 50 |   <file>
 51 |     <path>path/to/file</path>
 52 |     
 53 |   </file>
 54 | </args>
 55 | </read_file>
 56 | 
 57 | Examples:
 58 | 
 59 | 1. Reading a single file:
 60 | <read_file>
 61 | <args>
 62 |   <file>
 63 |     <path>src/app.ts</path>
 64 |     
 65 |   </file>
 66 | </args>
 67 | </read_file>
 68 | 
 69 | 2. Reading multiple files (within the 5-file limit):
 70 | <read_file>
 71 | <args>
 72 |   <file>
 73 |     <path>src/app.ts</path>
 74 |     
 75 |   </file>
 76 |   <file>
 77 |     <path>src/utils.ts</path>
 78 |     
 79 |   </file>
 80 | </args>
 81 | </read_file>
 82 | 
 83 | 3. Reading an entire file:
 84 | <read_file>
 85 | <args>
 86 |   <file>
 87 |     <path>config.json</path>
 88 |   </file>
 89 | </args>
 90 | </read_file>
 91 | 
 92 | IMPORTANT: You MUST use this Efficient Reading Strategy:
 93 | - You MUST read all related files and implementations together in a single operation (up to 5 files at once)
 94 | - You MUST obtain all necessary context before proceeding with changes
 95 | 
 96 | - When you need to read more than 5 files, prioritize the most critical files first, then use subsequent read_file requests for additional files
 97 | 
 98 | ## fetch_instructions
 99 | Description: Request to fetch instructions to perform a task
100 | Parameters:
101 | - task: (required) The task to get instructions for.  This can take the following values:

109 | </fetch_instructions>
110 | 
111 | ## search_files
112 | Description: Request to perform a regex search across files in a specified directory, providing context-rich results. This tool searches for patterns or specific content across multiple files, displaying each match with encapsulating context.
113 | Parameters:
114 | - path: (required) The path of the directory to search in (relative to the current workspace directory /test/path). This directory will be recursively searched.
115 | - regex: (required) The regular expression pattern to search for. Uses Rust regex syntax.
116 | - file_pattern: (optional) Glob pattern to filter files (e.g., '*.ts' for TypeScript files). If not provided, it will search all files (*).
117 | Usage:
118 | <search_files>
119 | <path>Directory path here</path>
120 | <regex>Your regex pattern here</regex>
121 | <file_pattern>file pattern here (optional)</file_pattern>
122 | </search_files>
123 | 
124 | Example: Requesting to search for all .ts files in the current directory
125 | <search_files>
126 | <path>.</path>
127 | <regex>.*</regex>
128 | <file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
129 | </search_files>
130 | 
131 | ## list_files
132 | Description: Request to list files and directories within the specified directory. If recursive is true, it will list all files and directories recursively. If recursive is false or not provided, it will only list the top-level contents. Do not use this tool to confirm the existence of files you may have created, as the user will let you know if the files were created successfully or not.
133 | Parameters:
134 | - path: (required) The path of the directory to list contents for (relative to the current workspace directory /test/path)
135 | - recursive: (optional) Whether to list files recursively. Use true for recursive listing, false or omit for top-level only.
136 | Usage:

146 | </list_files>
147 | 
148 | ## list_code_definition_names
149 | Description: Request to list definition names (classes, functions, methods, etc.) from source code. This tool can analyze either a single file or all files at the top level of a specified directory. It provides insights into the codebase structure and important constructs, encapsulating high-level concepts and relationships that are crucial for understanding the overall architecture.
150 | Parameters:
151 | - path: (required) The path of the file or directory (relative to the current working directory /test/path) to analyze. When given a directory, it lists definitions from all top-level source files.

158 | 
159 | 1. List definitions from a specific file:
160 | <list_code_definition_names>
161 | <path>src/main.ts</path>
162 | </list_code_definition_names>
163 | 
164 | 2. List definitions from all files in a directory:
165 | <list_code_definition_names>
166 | <path>src/</path>
167 | </list_code_definition_names>
168 | 
169 | ## write_to_file
170 | Description: Request to write content to a file. This tool is primarily used for **creating new files** or for scenarios where a **complete rewrite of an existing file is intentionally required**. If the file exists, it will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it will be created. This tool will automatically create any directories needed to write the file.
171 | Parameters:
172 | - path: (required) The path of the file to write to (relative to the current workspace directory /test/path)
173 | - content: (required) The content to write to the file. When performing a full rewrite of an existing file or creating a new one, ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE intended content of the file, without any truncation or omissions. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified. Do NOT include the line numbers in the content though, just the actual content of the file.
174 | - line_count: (required) The number of lines in the file. Make sure to compute this based on the actual content of the file, not the number of lines in the content you're providing.
175 | Usage:
176 | <write_to_file>
177 | <path>File path here</path>
178 | <content>
179 | Your file content here

201 | }
202 | </content>
203 | <line_count>14</line_count>
204 | </write_to_file>
205 | 
206 | ## insert_content
207 | Description: Use this tool specifically for adding new lines of content into a file without modifying existing content. Specify the line number to insert before, or use line 0 to append to the end. Ideal for adding imports, functions, configuration blocks, log entries, or any multi-line text block.
208 | 
209 | Parameters:
210 | - path: (required) File path relative to workspace directory /test/path
211 | - line: (required) Line number where content will be inserted (1-based)
212 | 	      Use 0 to append at end of file
213 | 	      Use any positive number to insert before that line
214 | - content: (required) The content to insert at the specified line
215 | 
216 | Example for inserting imports at start of file:
217 | <insert_content>
218 | <path>src/utils.ts</path>
219 | <line>1</line>
220 | <content>
221 | // Add imports at start of file
222 | import { sum } from './math';
223 | </content>
224 | </insert_content>
225 | 
226 | Example for appending to the end of file:
227 | <insert_content>
228 | <path>src/utils.ts</path>
229 | <line>0</line>

232 | </content>
233 | </insert_content>
234 | 
235 | 
236 | ## search_and_replace
237 | Description: Use this tool to find and replace specific text strings or patterns (using regex) within a file. It's suitable for targeted replacements across multiple locations within the file. Supports literal text and regex patterns, case sensitivity options, and optional line ranges. Shows a diff preview before applying changes.
238 | 
239 | Required Parameters:
240 | - path: The path of the file to modify (relative to the current workspace directory /test/path)
241 | - search: The text or pattern to search for
242 | - replace: The text to replace matches with
243 | 
244 | Optional Parameters:
245 | - start_line: Starting line number for restricted replacement (1-based)
246 | - end_line: Ending line number for restricted replacement (1-based)
247 | - use_regex: Set to "true" to treat search as a regex pattern (default: false)
248 | - ignore_case: Set to "true" to ignore case when matching (default: false)
249 | 
250 | Notes:
251 | - When use_regex is true, the search parameter is treated as a regular expression pattern
252 | - When ignore_case is true, the search is case-insensitive regardless of regex mode
253 | 
254 | Examples:
255 | 
256 | 1. Simple text replacement:
257 | <search_and_replace>
258 | <path>example.ts</path>
259 | <search>oldText</search>
260 | <replace>newText</replace>
261 | </search_and_replace>

267 | <replace>new$&</replace>
268 | <use_regex>true</use_regex>
269 | <ignore_case>true</ignore_case>
270 | </search_and_replace>
271 | 
272 | ## ask_followup_question
273 | Description: Ask the user a question to gather additional information needed to complete the task. This tool should be used when you encounter ambiguities, need clarification, or require more details to proceed effectively. It allows for interactive problem-solving by enabling direct communication with the user. Use this tool judiciously to maintain a balance between gathering necessary information and avoiding excessive back-and-forth.
274 | Parameters:
275 | - question: (required) The question to ask the user. This should be a clear, specific question that addresses the information you need.
276 | - follow_up: (required) A list of 2-4 suggested answers that logically follow from the question, ordered by priority or logical sequence. Each suggestion must:
277 |   1. Be provided in its own <suggest> tag
278 |   2. Be specific, actionable, and directly related to the completed task
279 |   3. Be a complete answer to the question - the user should not need to provide additional information or fill in any missing details. DO NOT include placeholders with brackets or parentheses.
280 |   4. Optionally include a mode attribute to switch to a specific mode when the suggestion is selected: <suggest mode="mode-slug">suggestion text</suggest>
281 |      - When using the mode attribute, focus the suggestion text on the action to be taken rather than mentioning the mode switch, as the mode change is handled automatically and indicated by a visual badge

311 | <suggest>Continue with more details</suggest>
312 | </follow_up>
313 | </ask_followup_question>
314 | 
315 | ## attempt_completion
316 | Description: After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of that tool use, i.e. if it succeeded or failed, along with any reasons for failure. Once you've received the results of tool uses and can confirm that the task is complete, use this tool to present the result of your work to the user. The user may respond with feedback if they are not satisfied with the result, which you can use to make improvements and try again.
317 | IMPORTANT NOTE: This tool CANNOT be used until you've confirmed from the user that any previous tool uses were successful. Failure to do so will result in code corruption and system failure. Before using this tool, you must ask yourself in <thinking></thinking> tags if you've confirmed from the user that any previous tool uses were successful. If not, then DO NOT use this tool.
318 | Parameters:
319 | - result: (required) The result of the task. Formulate this result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user. Don't end your result with questions or offers for further assistance.

331 | </result>
332 | </attempt_completion>
333 | 
334 | ## switch_mode
335 | Description: Request to switch to a different mode. This tool allows modes to request switching to another mode when needed, such as switching to Code mode to make code changes. The user must approve the mode switch.
336 | Parameters:
337 | - mode_slug: (required) The slug of the mode to switch to (e.g., "code", "ask", "architect")
338 | - reason: (optional) The reason for switching modes

367 | <message>Implement a new feature for the application.</message>
368 | </new_task>
369 | 
370 | 
371 | ## update_todo_list
372 | 
373 | **Description:**
374 | Replace the entire TODO list with an updated checklist reflecting the current state. Always provide the full list; the system will overwrite the previous one. This tool is designed for step-by-step task tracking, allowing you to confirm completion of each step before updating, update multiple task statuses at once (e.g., mark one as completed and start the next), and dynamically add new todos discovered during long or complex tasks.
375 | 
376 | **Checklist Format:**
377 | - Use a single-level markdown checklist (no nesting or subtasks).
378 | - List todos in the intended execution order.
379 | - Status options:
380 | 	 - [ ] Task description (pending)
381 | 	 - [x] Task description (completed)
382 | 	 - [-] Task description (in progress)
383 | 
384 | **Status Rules:**
385 | - [ ] = pending (not started)
386 | - [x] = completed (fully finished, no unresolved issues)
387 | - [-] = in_progress (currently being worked on)
388 | 
389 | **Core Principles:**
390 | - Before updating, always confirm which todos have been completed since the last update.
391 | - You may update multiple statuses in a single update (e.g., mark the previous as completed and the next as in progress).
392 | - When a new actionable item is discovered during a long or complex task, add it to the todo list immediately.
393 | - Do not remove any unfinished todos unless explicitly instructed.
394 | - Always retain all unfinished tasks, updating their status as needed.
395 | - Only mark a task as completed when it is fully accomplished (no partials, no unresolved dependencies).
396 | - If a task is blocked, keep it as in_progress and add a new todo describing what needs to be resolved.
397 | - Remove tasks only if they are no longer relevant or if the user requests deletion.
398 | 
399 | **Usage Example:**
400 | <update_todo_list>
401 | <todos>
402 | [x] Analyze requirements
403 | [x] Design architecture
404 | [-] Implement core logic
405 | [ ] Write tests
406 | [ ] Update documentation
407 | </todos>
408 | </update_todo_list>
409 | 
410 | *After completing "Implement core logic" and starting "Write tests":*
411 | <update_todo_list>
412 | <todos>
413 | [x] Analyze requirements
414 | [x] Design architecture
415 | [x] Implement core logic
416 | [-] Write tests
417 | [ ] Update documentation
418 | [ ] Add performance benchmarks
419 | </todos>
420 | </update_todo_list>
421 | 
422 | **When to Use:**
423 | - The task is complicated or involves multiple steps or requires ongoing tracking.
424 | - You need to update the status of several todos at once.
425 | - New actionable items are discovered during task execution.
426 | - The user requests a todo list or provides multiple tasks.
427 | - The task is complex and benefits from clear, stepwise progress tracking.
428 | 
429 | **When NOT to Use:**
430 | - There is only a single, trivial task.
431 | - The task can be completed in one or two simple steps.
432 | - The request is purely conversational or informational.
433 | 
434 | **Task Management Guidelines:**
435 | - Mark task as completed immediately after all work of the current task is done.
436 | - Start the next task by marking it as in_progress.
437 | - Add new todos as soon as they are identified.
438 | - Use clear, descriptive task names.
439 | 
440 | 
441 | # Tool Use Guidelines
442 | 
443 | 1. In <thinking> tags, assess what information you already have and what information you need to proceed with the task.
444 | 2. Choose the most appropriate tool based on the task and the tool descriptions provided. Assess if you need additional information to proceed, and which of the available tools would be most effective for gathering this information. For example using the list_files tool is more effective than running a command like `ls` in the terminal. It's critical that you think about each available tool and use the one that best fits the current step in the task.
445 | 3. If multiple actions are needed, use one tool at a time per message to accomplish the task iteratively, with each tool use being informed by the result of the previous tool use. Do not assume the outcome of any tool use. Each step must be informed by the previous step's result.
446 | 4. Formulate your tool use using the XML format specified for each tool.
447 | 5. After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of that tool use. This result will provide you with the necessary information to continue your task or make further decisions. This response may include:
448 |   - Information about whether the tool succeeded or failed, along with any reasons for failure.
449 |   - Linter errors that may have arisen due to the changes you made, which you'll need to address.
450 |   - New terminal output in reaction to the changes, which you may need to consider or act upon.
451 |   - Any other relevant feedback or information related to the tool use.
452 | 6. ALWAYS wait for user confirmation after each tool use before proceeding. Never assume the success of a tool use without explicit confirmation of the result from the user.
453 | 
454 | It is crucial to proceed step-by-step, waiting for the user's message after each tool use before moving forward with the task. This approach allows you to:
455 | 1. Confirm the success of each step before proceeding.
456 | 2. Address any issues or errors that arise immediately.
457 | 3. Adapt your approach based on new information or unexpected results.
458 | 4. Ensure that each action builds correctly on the previous ones.
459 | 
460 | By waiting for and carefully considering the user's response after each tool use, you can react accordingly and make informed decisions about how to proceed with the task. This iterative process helps ensure the overall success and accuracy of your work.

464 | ====
465 | 
466 | CAPABILITIES
467 | 
468 | - You have access to tools that let you execute CLI commands on the user's computer, list files, view source code definitions, regex search, read and write files, and ask follow-up questions. These tools help you effectively accomplish a wide range of tasks, such as writing code, making edits or improvements to existing files, understanding the current state of a project, performing system operations, and much more.
469 | - When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('/test/path') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.
470 | - You can use search_files to perform regex searches across files in a specified directory, outputting context-rich results that include surrounding lines. This is particularly useful for understanding code patterns, finding specific implementations, or identifying areas that need refactoring.
471 | - You can use the list_code_definition_names tool to get an overview of source code definitions for all files at the top level of a specified directory. This can be particularly useful when you need to understand the broader context and relationships between certain parts of the code. You may need to call this tool multiple times to understand various parts of the codebase related to the task.
472 |     - For example, when asked to make edits or improvements you might analyze the file structure in the initial environment_details to get an overview of the project, then use list_code_definition_names to get further insight using source code definitions for files located in relevant directories, then read_file to examine the contents of relevant files, analyze the code and suggest improvements or make necessary edits, then use the write_to_file tool to apply the changes. If you refactored code that could affect other parts of the codebase, you could use search_files to ensure you update other files as needed.
473 | - You can use the execute_command tool to run commands on the user's computer whenever you feel it can help accomplish the user's task. When you need to execute a CLI command, you must provide a clear explanation of what the command does. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, since they are more flexible and easier to run. Interactive and long-running commands are allowed, since the commands are run in the user's VSCode terminal. The user may keep commands running in the background and you will be kept updated on their status along the way. Each command you execute is run in a new terminal instance.

477 | MODES
478 | 
479 | - Test modes section
480 | 
481 | ====
482 | 
483 | RULES
484 | 
485 | - The project base directory is: /test/path
486 | - All file paths must be relative to this directory. However, commands may change directories in terminals, so respect working directory specified by the response to <execute_command>.
487 | - You cannot `cd` into a different directory to complete a task. You are stuck operating from '/test/path', so be sure to pass in the correct 'path' parameter when using tools that require a path.
488 | - Do not use the ~ character or $HOME to refer to the home directory.
489 | - Before using the execute_command tool, you must first think about the SYSTEM INFORMATION context provided to understand the user's environment and tailor your commands to ensure they are compatible with their system. You must also consider if the command you need to run should be executed in a specific directory outside of the current working directory '/test/path', and if so prepend with `cd`'ing into that directory && then executing the command (as one command since you are stuck operating from '/test/path'). For example, if you needed to run `npm install` in a project outside of '/test/path', you would need to prepend with a `cd` i.e. pseudocode for this would be `cd (path to project) && (command, in this case npm install)`.
490 | - When using the search_files tool, craft your regex patterns carefully to balance specificity and flexibility. Based on the user's task you may use it to find code patterns, TODO comments, function definitions, or any text-based information across the project. The results include context, so analyze the surrounding code to better understand the matches. Leverage the search_files tool in combination with other tools for more comprehensive analysis. For example, use it to find specific code patterns, then use read_file to examine the full context of interesting matches before using write_to_file to make informed changes.
491 | - When creating a new project (such as an app, website, or any software project), organize all new files within a dedicated project directory unless the user specifies otherwise. Use appropriate file paths when writing files, as the write_to_file tool will automatically create any necessary directories. Structure the project logically, adhering to best practices for the specific type of project being created. Unless otherwise specified, new projects should be easily run without additional setup, for example most projects can be built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - which you can open in a browser.
492 | - For editing files, you have access to these tools: write_to_file (for creating new files or complete file rewrites), insert_content (for adding lines to files), search_and_replace (for finding and replacing individual pieces of text).
493 | - The insert_content tool adds lines of text to files at a specific line number, such as adding a new function to a JavaScript file or inserting a new route in a Python file. Use line number 0 to append at the end of the file, or any positive number to insert before that line.
494 | - The search_and_replace tool finds and replaces text or regex in files. This tool allows you to search for a specific regex pattern or text and replace it with another value. Be cautious when using this tool to ensure you are replacing the correct text. It can support multiple operations at once.
495 | - You should always prefer using other editing tools over write_to_file when making changes to existing files since write_to_file is much slower and cannot handle large files.
496 | - When using the write_to_file tool to modify a file, use the tool directly with the desired content. You do not need to display the content before using the tool. ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE file content in your response. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Partial updates or placeholders like '// rest of code unchanged' are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified. Failure to do so will result in incomplete or broken code, severely impacting the user's project.
497 | - Some modes have restrictions on which files they can edit. If you attempt to edit a restricted file, the operation will be rejected with a FileRestrictionError that will specify which file patterns are allowed for the current mode.
498 | - Be sure to consider the type of project (e.g. Python, JavaScript, web application) when determining the appropriate structure and files to include. Also consider what files may be most relevant to accomplishing the task, for example looking at a project's manifest file would help you understand the project's dependencies, which you could incorporate into any code you write.
499 |   * For example, in architect mode trying to edit app.js would be rejected because architect mode can only edit files matching "\.md$"
500 | - When making changes to code, always consider the context in which the code is being used. Ensure that your changes are compatible with the existing codebase and that they follow the project's coding standards and best practices.
501 | - Do not ask for more information than necessary. Use the tools provided to accomplish the user's request efficiently and effectively. When you've completed your task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result to the user. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again.
502 | - You are only allowed to ask the user questions using the ask_followup_question tool. Use this tool only when you need additional details to complete a task, and be sure to use a clear and concise question that will help you move forward with the task. When you ask a question, provide the user with 2-4 suggested answers based on your question so they don't need to do so much typing. The suggestions should be specific, actionable, and directly related to the completed task. They should be ordered by priority or logical sequence. However if you can use the available tools to avoid having to ask the user questions, you should do so. For example, if the user mentions a file that may be in an outside directory like the Desktop, you should use the list_files tool to list the files in the Desktop and check if the file they are talking about is there, rather than asking the user to provide the file path themselves.
503 | - When executing commands, if you don't see the expected output, assume the terminal executed the command successfully and proceed with the task. The user's terminal may be unable to stream the output back properly. If you absolutely need to see the actual terminal output, use the ask_followup_question tool to request the user to copy and paste it back to you.
504 | - The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.
505 | - Your goal is to try to accomplish the user's task, NOT engage in a back and forth conversation.
506 | - NEVER end attempt_completion result with a question or request to engage in further conversation! Formulate the end of your result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user.
507 | - You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from starting your messages with "Great", "Certainly", "Okay", "Sure". You should NOT be conversational in your responses, but rather direct and to the point. For example you should NOT say "Great, I've updated the CSS" but instead something like "I've updated the CSS". It is important you be clear and technical in your messages.
508 | - When presented with images, utilize your vision capabilities to thoroughly examine them and extract meaningful information. Incorporate these insights into your thought process as you accomplish the user's task.
509 | - At the end of each user message, you will automatically receive environment_details. This information is not written by the user themselves, but is auto-generated to provide potentially relevant context about the project structure and environment. While this information can be valuable for understanding the project context, do not treat it as a direct part of the user's request or response. Use it to inform your actions and decisions, but don't assume the user is explicitly asking about or referring to this information unless they clearly do so in their message. When using environment_details, explain your actions clearly to ensure the user understands, as they may not be aware of these details.
510 | - Before executing commands, check the "Actively Running Terminals" section in environment_details. If present, consider how these active processes might impact your task. For example, if a local development server is already running, you wouldn't need to start it again. If no active terminals are listed, proceed with command execution as normal.
511 | - MCP operations should be used one at a time, similar to other tool usage. Wait for confirmation of success before proceeding with additional operations.
512 | - It is critical you wait for the user's response after each tool use, in order to confirm the success of the tool use. For example, if asked to make a todo app, you would create a file, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, then create another file if needed, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, etc.

516 | SYSTEM INFORMATION
517 | 
518 | Operating System: Linux
519 | Default Shell: /bin/zsh
520 | Home Directory: /home/user
521 | Current Workspace Directory: /test/path
522 | 
523 | The Current Workspace Directory is the active VS Code project directory, and is therefore the default directory for all tool operations. New terminals will be created in the current workspace directory, however if you change directories in a terminal it will then have a different working directory; changing directories in a terminal does not modify the workspace directory, because you do not have access to change the workspace directory. When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('/test/path') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.

525 | ====
526 | 
527 | OBJECTIVE
528 | 
529 | You accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.
530 | 
531 | 1. Analyze the user's task and set clear, achievable goals to accomplish it. Prioritize these goals in a logical order.
532 | 2. Work through these goals sequentially, utilizing available tools one at a time as necessary. Each goal should correspond to a distinct step in your problem-solving process. You will be informed on the work completed and what's remaining as you go.
533 | 3. Remember, you have extensive capabilities with access to a wide range of tools that can be used in powerful and clever ways as necessary to accomplish each goal. Before calling a tool, do some analysis within <thinking></thinking> tags. First, analyze the file structure provided in environment_details to gain context and insights for proceeding effectively. Next, think about which of the provided tools is the most relevant tool to accomplish the user's task. Go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool use. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the tool (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters using the ask_followup_question tool. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.
534 | 4. Once you've completed the user's task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result of the task to the user.
535 | 5. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again. But DO NOT continue in pointless back and forth conversations, i.e. don't end your responses with questions or offers for further assistance.

540 | USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS
541 | 
542 | The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.
543 | 
544 | Language Preference:
545 | You should always speak and think in the "en" language.
546 | 
547 | Mode-specific Instructions:
548 | 1. Do some information gathering (using provided tools) to get more context about the task.
549 | 
550 | 2. You should also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task.
551 | 
552 | 3. Once you've gained more context about the user's request, break down the task into clear, actionable steps and create a todo list using the `update_todo_list` tool. Each todo item should be:
553 |    - Specific and actionable
554 |    - Listed in logical execution order
555 |    - Focused on a single, well-defined outcome
556 |    - Clear enough that another mode could execute it independently
557 | 
558 |    **Note:** If the `update_todo_list` tool is not available, write the plan to a markdown file (e.g., `plan.md` or `todo.md`) instead.
559 | 
560 | 4. As you gather more information or discover new requirements, update the todo list to reflect the current understanding of what needs to be accomplished.
561 | 
562 | 5. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and refine the todo list.
563 | 
564 | 6. Include Mermaid diagrams if they help clarify complex workflows or system architecture. Please avoid using double quotes ("") and parentheses () inside square brackets ([]) in Mermaid diagrams, as this can cause parsing errors.
565 | 
566 | 7. Use the switch_mode tool to request that the user switch to another mode to implement the solution.
567 | 
568 | **IMPORTANT: Focus on creating clear, actionable todo lists rather than lengthy markdown documents. Use the todo list as your primary planning tool to track and organize the work that needs to be done.**

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint

1. Architect
2. Code  
3. Ask
4. Debug
5. Orchestrator

Let me create mode-specific rule directories and XML files for each mode following the existing pattern:

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule</custom_instructions>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\1_implementation_workflow.xml:

# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule</custom_instructions>

- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule</custom_instructions>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\1_implementation_workflow.xml:

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule</custom_instructions>

# Tool Usage Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for effective and efficient use of available tools across all modes and contexts.

## Core Tool Usage Principles

### 1. Tool Selection Strategy
- **Choose the most appropriate tool** for each specific task
- **Consider tool limitations** and capabilities before use
- **Prefer specialized tools** over general-purpose alternatives when available
- **Use tool combinations** for complex multi-step operations

### 2. Efficiency Optimization
- **Batch operations** when possible (e.g., read multiple files at once)
- **Minimize redundant tool calls** by planning ahead
- **Cache results** when appropriate for repeated access
- **Use targeted approaches** rather than broad searches

### 3. Error Handling and Validation
- **Always validate tool outputs** before proceeding
- **Handle tool failures gracefully** with fallback strategies
- **Document assumptions** about tool behavior
- **Verify results** through multiple methods when critical

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Context Optimization Principles

## Overview
This document outlines the principles and strategies for optimizing context usage to improve AI performance, reduce costs, and enhance response quality.

## Core Optimization Principles

### 1. Context Relevance
**Principle:** Include only information directly relevant to the current task
- **Focus on immediacy:** Prioritize information needed for immediate decisions
- **Eliminate redundancy:** Remove duplicate or overlapping information
- **Filter by purpose:** Include context based on specific task requirements
- **Temporal relevance:** Consider the time sensitivity of information

### 2. Information Density
**Principle:** Maximize useful information per token while maintaining clarity
- **Compress when possible:** Use concise representations of complex information
- **Prioritize key details:** Focus on critical elements over comprehensive coverage
- **Structure for efficiency:** Organize information to minimize parsing overhead
- **Remove noise:** Eliminate irrelevant details and formatting artifacts

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
**Principle:** Provide context incrementally based on demonstrated need
- **Start minimal:** Begin with core essentials
- **Expand gradually:** Add detail as complexity increases
- **Respond to queries:** Provide additional context in response to specific questions
- **Adapt dynamically:** Adjust depth based on task progression

## Context Management Strategies

### Strategic Information Selection
1. **Task Analysis:** Identify essential information categories
2. **Dependency Mapping:** Understand information relationships
3. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate information value vs. cost
4. **Priority Ranking:** Order information by importance and relevance

### Efficient Information Presentation
1. **Hierarchical Organization:** Structure from general to specific
2. **Modular Format:** Break into digestible, self-contained sections
3. **Cross-Referencing:** Link related information without duplication
4. **Summary Provision:** Provide executive summaries for complex topics

### Dynamic Context Adjustment
1. **Real-time Monitoring:** Track context utilization effectiveness
2. **Feedback Integration:** Adjust based on task outcomes
3. **Pattern Recognition:** Identify recurring context needs
4. **Continuous Optimization:** Refine context strategies over time

## Cost-Benefit Optimization

### Token Efficiency
- **Calculate information value:** Assess usefulness per token consumed
- **Optimize representation:** Use the most compact effective format
- **Balance completeness:** Trade off detail level against cost constraints
- **Monitor usage patterns:** Track token consumption by task type

### Performance Enhancement
- **Reduce cognitive load:** Present information in digestible chunks
- **Improve retrieval speed:** Structure for quick access to key details
- **Minimize processing overhead:** Eliminate unnecessary complexity
- **Enhance decision quality:** Focus on decision-relevant information

## Context Quality Standards

### Accuracy and Currency
- **Verify information validity:** Ensure data is current and correct
- **Source documentation:** Track information origins and reliability
- **Update mechanisms:** Maintain current versions of dynamic information
- **Error identification:** Quickly spot and address inaccuracies

### Completeness and Consistency
- **Gap analysis:** Identify missing critical information
- **Cross-validation:** Ensure consistency across related contexts
- **Boundary definition:** Clearly specify scope and limitations
- **Integration quality:** Seamlessly combine multiple information sources

## Implementation Guidelines

### Context Gathering
1. **Purpose-driven collection:** Gather only what's needed for specific tasks
2. **Source prioritization:** Use most reliable and relevant sources first
3. **Format standardization:** Present information in consistent formats
4. **Update protocols:** Establish procedures for keeping context current

### Context Presentation
1. **Structured formatting:** Use clear headings and organization
2. **Key information highlighting:** Emphasize critical elements
3. **Navigation aids:** Provide clear paths through complex information
4. **Summary provision:** Include executive summaries for lengthy content

### Context Maintenance
1. **Regular review:** Periodically assess context relevance and accuracy
2. **Performance metrics:** Track context effectiveness metrics
3. **User feedback:** Incorporate user experience insights
4. **Continuous improvement:** Refine context strategies based on results

## Optimization Techniques

### Information Compression
- **Abstraction levels:** Provide multiple detail levels as needed
- **Pattern recognition:** Identify and leverage common structures
- **Standard templates:** Use consistent formats for similar information
- **Reference systems:** Link to detailed information rather than including it

### Context Chunking
- **Logical grouping:** Organize related information into coherent units
- **Size optimization:** Balance chunk size against retrieval efficiency
- **Boundary definition:** Clearly mark chunk beginnings and endings
- **Cross-chunk linking:** Maintain connections between related chunks

### Adaptive Context Delivery
- **User behavior analysis:** Learn from interaction patterns
- **Task progression tracking:** Adjust context based on workflow stage
- **Performance monitoring:** Measure and optimize delivery effectiveness
- **Personalization:** Tailor context to individual user preferences and needs

## Quality Assurance

### Context Validation
- **Relevance testing:** Verify information applicability to tasks
- **Accuracy verification:** Confirm data correctness and currency
- **Completeness checks:** Ensure essential information is included
- **Consistency audits:** Maintain coherence across related contexts

### Performance Metrics
- **Task completion rates:** Measure success with optimized context
- **Response quality:** Assess information usefulness and accuracy
- **Efficiency measures:** Track time and resource utilization
- **User satisfaction:** Monitor feedback and experience quality

### Continuous Improvement
- **Regular assessment:** Periodically review context optimization strategies
- **Feedback integration:** Incorporate lessons learned from usage
- **Technology adaptation:** Leverage new tools and techniques
- **Best practice evolution:** Continuously refine optimization approaches

## Risk Management

### Over-Contextualization Risks
- **Information overload:** Avoid overwhelming users with excessive detail
- **Analysis paralysis:** Prevent decision delays from too many options
- **Cost escalation:** Control token usage and associated expenses
- **Performance degradation:** Maintain response speed and quality

### Under-Contextualization Risks
- **Insufficient information:** Ensure adequate detail for task completion
- **Quality compromises:** Maintain high standards despite optimization
- **User frustration:** Prevent repeated requests for missing information
- **Task failure:** Avoid incomplete or incorrect outcomes

## Best Practices Summary

### Do's
- Prioritize information based on immediate task needs
- Structure context for easy scanning and retrieval
- Provide clear navigation through complex information
- Maintain current and accurate information
- Monitor and optimize token usage efficiency
- Adapt context strategies based on feedback

### Don'ts
- Don't include irrelevant historical information
- Don't duplicate information across multiple sections
- Don't overload with excessive detail upfront
- Don't ignore user feedback on context effectiveness

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from rules-code directories:

# Rules from C:\Users\mkinney\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule

# Rules from c:\Repos\Hivemind\.kilocode\rules-code\use-safeWriteJson.md:
# JSON File Writing Must Be Atomic

- You MUST use `safeWriteJson(filePath: string, data: any): Promise<void>` from `src/utils/safeWriteJson.ts` instead of `JSON.stringify` with file-write operations
- `safeWriteJson` will create parent directories if necessary, so do not call `mkdir` prior to `safeWriteJson`
- `safeWriteJson` prevents data corruption via atomic writes with locking and streams the write to minimize memory footprint
- Test files are exempt from this rule</custom_instructions>

**Assistant:**

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have successfully completed a comprehensive audit and improvement of the .kilocode rules and prompt system for the Hivemind VS Code Extension project. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Comprehensive Analysis Completed
- Analyzed the current .kilocode directory structure and content
- Reviewed existing planning documents and system design
- Examined current rules and standards structure

## Core Infrastructure Implementation
- Created comprehensive metadata structure for all rules and standards
- Implemented proper file naming conventions and organization
- Established clear categorization system for different rule types

## Development Standards Created
- **Development Workflow Standards**: Created detailed implementation workflows and best practices covering code analysis, efficient reading strategies, implementation approaches, code quality standards, file operations, and verification processes
- **Documentation Standards**: Established comprehensive documentation practices including structure guidelines, content requirements, maintenance procedures, quality assurance, and version control integration

## Security Framework
- **Security Practices**: Implemented detailed security standards covering authentication, authorization, data protection, input validation, secure coding practices, dependency management, and incident response procedures

## Mode-Specific Rules System
Created specialized rule sets for each operational mode:
- **Architect Mode**: Planning workflows and design patterns for system architecture
- **Code Mode**: Implementation workflows and coding best practices
- **Ask Mode**: Question answering workflows and explanation techniques
- **Debug Mode**: Debugging workflows and techniques
- **Orchestrator Mode**: Coordination workflows and project management strategies

## Supporting Standards Framework
- **Tool Usage Guidelines**: Comprehensive guidelines for effective and efficient use of available tools across all modes
- **Context Optimization Principles**: Strategies for optimizing context usage to improve AI performance and reduce costs
- **Project Template Guidelines**: Standards for creating, using, and maintaining project templates
- **Testing and Validation Rules**: Comprehensive testing guidelines covering all testing categories and validation principles
- **Maintenance and Update Procedures**: Detailed procedures for system maintenance and updates

## Key Improvements Made
1. **Structured Organization**: Created a logical, hierarchical structure for all rules and standards
2. **Metadata Integration**: Added proper metadata to all rule files for better management
3. **Mode-Specific Optimization**: Tailored rules for each operational mode's specific needs
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addressed all aspects of software development lifecycle
5. **Standards Alignment**: Ensured consistency with industry best practices and existing system requirements
6. **Scalability**: Designed system to accommodate future growth and evolution

## Files Created
- 14 core rule and standard files across multiple categories
- XML and Markdown formats for different use cases
- Comprehensive documentation with detailed guidelines and best practices

The improved rules and prompt system is now aligned with the Hivemind system's goals of creating an autonomous development environment that can handle complex projects from planning through implementation, with proper context optimization, security, testing, and maintenance procedures. The system is ready to support the vision of a project request form manager that can autonomously build detailed plans, create PRDs, and execute development tasks with proper validation and quality assurance.
