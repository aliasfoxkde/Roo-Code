# Context Optimization Methodology

## Introduction

Context optimization is the process of selecting, organizing, and presenting information to AI systems in a way that maximizes their effectiveness and performance. This methodology provides a systematic approach to optimizing context for various AI applications.

## Core Principles

### 1. Relevance
Only include information that is directly relevant to the task at hand.
