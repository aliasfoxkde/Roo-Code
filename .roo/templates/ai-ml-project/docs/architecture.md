# AI/ML Project Template Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the AI/ML Project Template, which provides a scalable and maintainable structure for machine learning projects. The architecture follows best practices for ML engineering, including separation of concerns, modularity, and reproducibility.

## System Components

### 1. Data Layer

The data layer is responsible for data ingestion, preprocessing, and storage.

#### Components:
- **Data Ingestion**: Handles data loading from various sources (files, databases, APIs)
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans, transforms, and prepares data for modeling
- **Data Storage**: Stores processed data in efficient formats (Parquet, HDF5, etc.)

#### Technologies:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Dask (for large datasets)
- SQLAlchemy (for database connections)

### 2. Model Layer

The model layer contains the machine learning models and related functionality.

#### Components:
- **Model Training**: Implements training algorithms and hyperparameter optimization
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides metrics and evaluation tools
- **Model Inference**: Handles model predictions on new data
- **Model Registry**: Manages model versions and metadata

#### Technologies:
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional)
- MLflow (for model tracking)

### 3. API Layer

The API layer exposes the trained models as RESTful services.

#### Components:
- **Model Serving**: Deploys models as web services
- **API Gateway**: Handles requests and routing
- **Authentication**: Manages access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls API usage

#### Technologies:
- Flask/FastAPI
- Gunicorn
- Docker
- Kubernetes

### 4. Monitoring Layer

The monitoring layer provides observability into the system's performance and health.

#### Components:
- **Logging**: Centralized logging for debugging and audit
- **Metrics**: Performance and business metrics collection
- **Tracing**: Request tracing for debugging
- **Alerting**: Notifications for system issues

#### Technologies:
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Sentry
