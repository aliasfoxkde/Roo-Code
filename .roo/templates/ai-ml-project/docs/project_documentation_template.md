### Data Flow

1. Data is ingested from various sources
2. Data is stored in appropriate storage systems
3. Data is preprocessed and transformed
4. Features are engineered and stored
5. Models are trained on the processed data
6. Models are deployed for serving
7. Predictions are made and returned to clients
