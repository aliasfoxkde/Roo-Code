## Introduction

<!-- Overview of the project for developers -->

This guide is intended for developers who want to contribute to the AI/ML Project Template. It covers the project structure, development environment setup, coding standards, architecture, testing, and deployment processes.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

<!-- Required software and tools -->

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git version control
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- Virtual environment tool (venv or conda)

### Setup

<!-- Step-by-step setup instructions -->

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-ml-project-template.git
   cd ai-ml-project-template
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/development.txt
   ```

4. Install the package in development mode:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. Install pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### IDE Configuration

<!-- IDE setup instructions -->

#### Visual Studio Code

1. Install the Python extension
2. Install the Pylint extension
3. Install the Black formatter extension
4. Configure the Python interpreter to use the virtual environment
5. Set up launch configurations for debugging

#### PyCharm

1. Open the project in PyCharm
2. Configure the Python interpreter to use the virtual environment
3. Enable code inspection and formatting tools
4. Set up run configurations for testing

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

<!-- Python coding standards -->

The project follows the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide with some additional conventions:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Limit lines to 88 characters (compatible with Black formatter)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write docstrings for all public classes and functions
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values

Example:

```python
from typing import List, Optional


def calculate_accuracy(predictions: List[int], targets: List[int]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the accuracy of predictions.

    Args:
        predictions: List of predicted values.
        targets: List of true target values.

    Returns:
        float: Accuracy as a percentage.
    """
    if not predictions or len(predictions) != len(targets):
        raise ValueError("Predictions and targets must be non-empty and of equal length")

    correct = sum(p == t for p, t in zip(predictions, targets))
    return correct / len(predictions)
```

### Documentation Standards

<!-- Documentation standards -->

All code must be documented according to the [Documentation Standards](documentation_standards.md):

- Every module must have a docstring
- Every class must have a docstring
- Every function must have a docstring
- Complex algorithms must have inline comments
- Public APIs must be documented in the API documentation

### Testing Standards

<!-- Testing standards -->

All code must be tested according to the [Testing Standards](testing_standards.md):

- Every function must have unit tests
- Every module must have integration tests
- All tests must pass before merging
- Test coverage must be at least 80%
- Tests must be written using pytest

## Architecture

### Data Flow

<!-- Description of data flow through the system -->

```
Raw Data → Data Ingestion → Data Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Model Evaluation → Model Deployment
```

1. **Data Ingestion**: Load data from various sources (CSV, database, API)
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for modeling
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create and select relevant features
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance
6. **Model Deployment**: Deploy models for inference

### Model Pipeline

<!-- Description of the model pipeline -->

The model pipeline consists of several stages:

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess data
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create features from raw data
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithms
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters
5. **Training**: Train the final model
6. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance
7. **Validation**: Validate on unseen data

### API Layer

<!-- Description of the API layer -->

The API layer provides RESTful endpoints for model inference:

- `/predict`: Make predictions using trained models
- `/train`: Train new models
- `/model/info`: Get information about loaded models
- `/health`: Check service health

The API is built using Flask and follows REST conventions.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

<!-- Unit testing guidelines -->

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory and follow the same structure as the `src/` directory:

```
tests/
├── data/
├── models/
└── utils/
```

Run unit tests with:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/
```

### Integration Tests

<!-- Integration testing guidelines -->

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/
```

### End-to-End Tests

<!-- End-to-end testing guidelines -->

End-to-end tests verify the complete workflow:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/e2e/
```

## Contributing

### Git Workflow

<!-- Git workflow guidelines -->

The project follows the [Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Development branch
- `feature/*`: Feature branches
- `release/*`: Release branches
- `hotfix/*`: Hotfix branches

### Code Review Process

<!-- Code review process -->

All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other developer before merging:

1. Submit a pull request with clear description
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Address all review comments
4. Get approval from reviewers
5. Merge to target branch

### Pull Request Guidelines

<!-- Pull request guidelines -->

When creating a pull request:

- Provide a clear title and description
- Reference related issues
- Include screenshots or logs if applicable
- Ensure code follows coding standards
- Verify all tests pass
- Update documentation if needed

## Deployment

### Staging

<!-- Staging deployment process -->

Deploy to staging environment:

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t ai-ml-template:staging .

# Deploy to staging
kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
```

### Production

<!-- Production deployment process -->

Deploy to production environment:

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t ai-ml-template:latest .

# Deploy to production
kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
```

## Monitoring and Logging

<!-- Monitoring and logging setup -->

The application uses Prometheus for monitoring and structured logging:

- Metrics are exposed at `/metrics`
- Logs are written in JSON format
- Errors are tracked with Sentry
- Performance is monitored with New Relic
