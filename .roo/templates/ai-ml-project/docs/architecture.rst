Architecture
============

This document describes the architecture of the AI/ML Project Template.

Overview
--------

The AI/ML Project Template follows a modular architecture that separates concerns
into distinct components:

* **API Layer** - FastAPI-based RESTful interface
* **Business Logic Layer** - Core application logic
* **Data Layer** - Data processing and storage
* **Model Layer** - Machine learning models
* **Infrastructure Layer** - Configuration, logging, and utilities

High-Level Architecture
-----------------------

The architecture follows a layered approach:

1. **Client Applications** - External clients that interact with the API
2. **API Layer** - FastAPI endpoints that handle HTTP requests
3. **Business Logic Layer** - Core application logic and services
4. **Data Layer** - Data processing, storage, and retrieval
5. **Model Layer** - Machine learning model training and inference
6. **Infrastructure Layer** - Supporting components like configuration and logging

Component Details
-----------------

API Layer
~~~~~~~~

The API layer is built with FastAPI and provides RESTful endpoints for:

* Health checks
* Model predictions
* Model training
* Model information

Business Logic Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The business logic layer contains the core application logic:

* Controllers that handle API requests
* Services that implement business rules
* Tasks that perform background operations

Data Layer
~~~~~~~~~~

The data layer handles data processing and storage:

* Data processors for cleaning and transforming data
* Repositories for data access
* Caching mechanisms for performance

Model Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~

The model layer manages machine learning models:

* Trainers for model training
* Evaluators for model assessment
* Loaders for model persistence

Infrastructure Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The infrastructure layer provides supporting functionality:

* Configuration management
* Logging services
* Utility functions

Data Flow
---------

The typical data flow through the system:

1. Client sends HTTP request to API endpoint
2. API validates request and calls appropriate controller
3. Controller delegates to service for business logic
4. Service interacts with data layer for data processing
5. Service interacts with model layer for predictions
6. Results are returned through the API to the client

Deployment Architecture
----------------------

The template supports multiple deployment options:

* **Standalone** - Run directly on a server
* **Docker** - Containerized deployment
* **Docker Compose** - Multi-container deployment
* **Cloud** - Deploy to cloud platforms

Each deployment option provides the same functionality with different
infrastructure arrangements.
