# Specification Development Workflow

This document outlines the comprehensive workflow for developing new features and enhancements for the Roo Code VS Code Extension, from initial requirements gathering through implementation and deployment.

## Overview

The specification workflow ensures that all new features are well-planned, properly designed, and successfully implemented with minimal risk and maximum value delivery. This process is derived from proven methodologies and adapted for the Roo Code extension development context.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements Clarification

#### Objective
Gather comprehensive requirements and establish clear understanding of the feature or enhancement needed.

#### Activities
1. **Stakeholder Identification**

   - Understand different perspectives and needs
   - Document stakeholder priorities and constraints

2. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Conduct user interviews or surveys
   - Analyze existing feature requests and issues
   - Review competitive solutions and industry standards
   - Document functional and non-functional requirements

3. **Use Case Development**
   - Create detailed user stories and scenarios
   - Define acceptance criteria for each use case
   - Identify edge cases and error conditions
   - Validate use cases with stakeholders

4. **Constraint Analysis**
   - Technical constraints (VS Code API limitations, performance requirements)
   - Resource constraints (development time, team capacity)
   - Compatibility requirements (VS Code versions, operating systems)
   - Security and privacy considerations

#### Deliverables
- Requirements specification document
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Constraint analysis report
- Stakeholder approval and sign-off

### Phase 2: Design Document Creation

   - Design for scalability and maintainability

2. **Interface Design**
   - Define user interfaces (commands, views, settings)
   - Specify API interfaces for internal components
   - Design configuration schemas and file formats
   - Create wireframes or mockups for UI components

3. **Data Model Design**
   - Define data structures and schemas
   - Specify data persistence requirements
   - Design data migration strategies if needed
   - Consider data validation and integrity

4. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Identify potential failure points
   - Design error recovery mechanisms
   - Specify user-facing error messages
   - Plan logging and debugging support

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Define performance requirements and metrics
   - Identify potential bottlenecks
   - Design optimization strategies
   - Plan performance testing approaches

6. **Security Analysis**
   - Identify security risks and vulnerabilities
   - Design security controls and mitigations
   - Specify data protection requirements
   - Plan security testing procedures

#### Deliverables
- Technical design document with architecture diagrams
- Interface specifications and mockups
- Data model documentation
- Error handling and recovery plans
- Performance and security analysis
- Design review and approval

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

#### Objective
Break down the design into implementable tasks with clear dependencies, timelines, and resource allocation.

#### Activities
1. **Task Decomposition**
   - Break design into discrete, implementable tasks
   - Define task dependencies and critical path
   - Estimate effort and complexity for each task
   - Identify tasks that can be parallelized

2. **Development Phases**
   - Define implementation phases and milestones
   - Plan incremental delivery and testing
   - Identify minimum viable product (MVP) scope
   - Plan feature flags and gradual rollout

3. **Resource Planning**
   - Assign tasks to team members based on expertise
   - Identify skill gaps and training needs
   - Plan for code review and quality assurance
   - Allocate time for testing and documentation

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify technical and project risks
   - Develop risk mitigation strategies
   - Plan contingency approaches for high-risk items
   - Define escalation procedures

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Plan unit testing approach and coverage
   - Design integration testing scenarios
   - Specify user acceptance testing procedures
   - Plan performance and security testing

#### Deliverables
- Detailed implementation plan with task breakdown
- Resource allocation and timeline
- Risk assessment and mitigation plans
- Testing strategy and procedures
- Development team approval and commitment

### Phase 4: Task Execution

#### Objective
Implement the designed solution following established development practices and quality standards.

#### Activities
1. **Development Setup**
   - Set up development environment and tools
   - Create feature branches and development workspace
   - Configure continuous integration and testing
   - Establish communication and progress tracking

2. **Iterative Implementation**
   - Implement tasks according to the plan
   - Follow coding standards and best practices
   - Write tests alongside implementation
   - Conduct regular code reviews

3. **Integration and Testing**
   - Integrate components and test interactions
   - Execute unit and integration tests
   - Perform user acceptance testing
   - Conduct performance and security testing

4. **Documentation**
   - Update technical documentation
   - Create or update user documentation
   - Document configuration changes
   - Update API documentation if applicable

5. **Quality Assurance**
   - Code review and approval process
   - Automated testing and quality gates
   - Manual testing and validation
   - Performance benchmarking

#### Deliverables
- Implemented feature with full test coverage
- Updated documentation (technical and user)
- Quality assurance reports and approvals
- Deployment-ready code and artifacts
