## Contributing to These Rules

When updating or adding rules:

1. **Identify the correct category** - Place rules in the most appropriate file
2. **Maintain consistency** - Follow the established format and style
3. **Update cross-references** - Ensure links between files remain accurate
4. **Test examples** - Verify all code examples are functional and current
5. **Update this README** - Add new files or sections to the navigation

## Legacy Reference

The original comprehensive rules file has been preserved as `rules.md` for reference during the transition period. All content has been migrated to the modular structure above.
