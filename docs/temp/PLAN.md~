Based on in-depth analysis of Roo Code's architecture , VS Code extensibility best practices , and AI development workflows, here's a comprehensive SDLC plan for your Hivemind extension:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (4 Weeks)
* **Technical Assessment**
  * Audit Roo Code's core modules (agent orchestration, tooling system, API integrations)
  * Map existing data flows using [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) flowcharts:
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
    A[User Prompt] --> B(Orchestrator)
    B --> C{Model Routing}
    C --> D[Vision Model]
    C --> E[Code Model]
    C --> F[Embedding Model]
    D --> G[Browser Tools]
    E --> H[File Operations]
    F --> I[Vector DB]
    ```
* **Tech Stack Definition**
  - Core: TypeScript + VS Code API
  - AI: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector) for 384D embeddings
  - Local AI: Ollama/TabbyAPI for lightweight models
  - Testing: Jest + VS Code Test Runner

* **Security Framework**
  - Implement permission tiers (file/term access)
  - Add configurable sandboxing for browser automation
  - Integrate VS Code's untrusted workspace protocols

### Phase 2: Core Enhancements (6 Weeks)
* **Agent System Upgrades**

# Future Steps:

## Better documentation and Prompt Management
- Have VS Code Plugin extract documentation to a shared location accessible by Hivemind
- Use this documentation to handle rules, methodology, tasks, and etc.
- Make this documentation the Global default documentation for Hivemind
- Allow the user to create a .hivemind directory for project-specific overrides
- Change the documentation/prompt structure as needed to fit best with "Hivemind" (best practices)
- Create all user documentation for using Hivemind (including overrides, etc.)
- Integrate the prompts/documentation into the Hivemind VS Code UI in clean lists that open in the code editor (for better reviewing)
- Add a new section under Prompts for the documentation, called "System Prompts (Global)" grouped by category with links to the docs (make this the default you first see when clicking this tab/button). Think this section out and use deep research as needed to make sure it is very intuitive and easy to use.
- Allow the user to override the system prompt here either globally or project-specifically with advanced prompt override options.
- Additinally extract all current prompts in the list to the "prompts" folder and simply link to them to open in the editor for review (otherwise leaving the structure alone).
- When loading the VS Code extension, load all documentation and prompts into a local vector DB for fast searching and retrieval (globally)
- Add a "Documentation" section to the Hivemind UI that allows the user to search all documentation and prompts (with keyboard shortcut) and open them in the code editor for review.
- Index all ./hivemind documentation and prompts into a local vector DB for fast searching and retrieval (project-specific)
- Add the ability to add ${code_context} to any prompt to insert the current code context (with optional parameters for filtering, etc.)
- Add documentation on how to use dynamic variables and which ones are available such as existing: ${userInput}, ${filePath}, {startLine}, ${diagnosticText}, ${endLine}, ${userInput}, ${selectedText}, and ${terminalContent}.
- Enable the use of tools through the prompts (and add documentation on how to do so)
- Add documentation on how to create custom prompts and override system prompts (with examples)
- Add documentation links (that popout into the code editor) with examples to the appropriate sections in the UI (e.g. when you click "Prompts", it should have a link to the documentation on how to create custom prompts, etc.)
- Update the "About Roo Code" section to reflect the new name "Hivemind"and vision for the project.
  - Enable "Allow anonymous error and usage reporting" by default (and make it more visible in the settings)
  - Add option for "Check for Updates" to the "About Hivemind" section that checks for updates and allows the user to update (with progress bar, etc.)
  - Add "Changelog" section that shows the changelog for the current version and allows the user to view previous versions (with links to the docs, etc.)
  - Add "Vision" section that shows the vision and goals for the project (with links to the docs, etc.)
  - Add "Team" section that shows the team and their roles (with links to their github, etc.)
  - Add "Sponsor" section that shows the sponsors and their logos (with links to their website, etc.)
  - Add "Contributing" section that shows the contributing guidelines and how to get involved (with links to the docs, etc.)
  - Add "License" section that shows the license and links to the license file (with links to the docs, etc.)
  - Add "Privacy" section that shows the privacy policy and links to the privacy policy file (with links to the docs, etc.)
  - Add "Security" section that shows the security policy and links to the security policy file (with links to the docs, etc.)
  - Add "Code of Conduct" section that shows the code of conduct and links to the code of conduct file (with links to the docs, etc.)
  - Add "FAQ" section that shows the frequently asked questions and links to the FAQ file (with links to the docs, etc.)
  - Add Dropdown option for Opening Documentation in "Browser", "Code Editor", or Settings preview.

- Refine rules to read multiple files at one time but only edit one at a time.
